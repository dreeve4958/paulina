    <para>The man had been covertly watching Van der Boschstraat 12 for
    several days waiting for a chance to catch Johan Jacob alone but the woman
    of the house had shown no inclination to go out. Johan Jacob could be seen
    in his workroom, presumably pouring over his maps upon the hour, rather
    than venturing beyond his front door. It was, of course, only a matter of
    time before he answered the call of the ladies available to cater to his
    less cerebral needs. It was a pity that such a sojourn would likely take
    place during the late evening which fact meant that the man had to suffer
    the volatile weather of the spring season whilst waiting to gain some
    slight benefit from the cover of darkness. He endured everything from
    being warmed by blinding sunshine to attacked by hail and sleet borne on
    the winds of a squall. It was a challenge to his pride to maintain his
    reputation for inconspicuousness under such conditions, especially in the
    barrenness of a street of newly built villas.</para>

    <para>This particular day had begun dry and warm so that those wealthy
    enough to have the choice were venturing out for a stroll in order to
    enjoy the chirruping of the birdies and surging of sap in the flora.
    Meanwhile, their servants headed briskly along the street with purpose,
    either real or invented. Although at pains to dress appropriately for the
    weather and change his general appearance frequently, regulars might begin
    to sense something familiar about him and slow movers have the time to
    take him in. Time was running out. Fortunately a sudden, spring shower
    late in the afternoon drove everybody indoors then the activities above
    and below stairs relating to the ritual of dinner continued to keep most
    folk off the street and away from the windows.</para>

    <para>The weather had cleared up with nightfall to reveal an almost full
    moon and brilliant stars. Very nice and all that but the increased
    illumination made remaining invisible difficult yet again, added to which
    the temperature was plummeting towards a late frost. His cold, wet feet
    were starting to go numb but stamping some life and warmth back into them
    risked giving himself away to any nosey busybody. His damp clothes were
    steaming dry but taking the heat from his body with them and a drip was
    forming on the end of his nose.</para>

    <para>Ah, but look here! The front door was opening and, yes, the familiar
    figure of his quarry was emerging from it! The man quietly slipped onto
    the pavement behind Johan Jacob and followed him until they were safely
    out of view from the house before he took a small, round stone from his
    pocket and lobbed it at Johan Jacob's shoulder. Without breaking his
    stride, Johan Jacob walked on then suddenly diverged from his route and
    stooped into the concealing shelter of a low hanging tree. The man walked
    past, looking and listening, before satisfying himself that they were
    alone, then turning back to also duck under the dripping willow branches
    where Johan Jacob was waiting expectantly.</para>

    <para>"You will be deployed to Sumatra and must report for briefing at
    1600 the day after tomorrow. Go in uniform but take informal clothing. We
    will sort you out some better gear when you get to your destination.
    Travel light and with concealed small arms . You'll be away months rather
    than weeks. Questions? "</para>

    <para>Johan Jacob stared thoughtfully at his shoes then nodded his head to
    accept the brief before adding,</para>

    <para>"Then I had better make haste and take full use of the delights on
    offer tonight."</para>

    <para>With that, he turned on his heel and strode off into the
    night.</para>

    <para>The man waited until the footsteps had died away before peering
    through the drooping willow branches to ensure that the coast was clear.
    He quietly took himself off in the direction of the less salubrious parts
    of Den Haag where he would not attract attention in a smoke-filled bar
    which specialised in cheap <emphasis>jenever</emphasis>. The result of his
    ensuing efforts to stave off hypothermia through the ingestion of rough
    spirit was that pretty much all of him, not just his extremities, was
    pleasantly anaesthetized by the time he set out for the docks at
    Scheveningen. He had also contrived to spill most of his last shot
    of<emphasis> jenever</emphasis> down his front, which was a necessary
    waste! Luckily the novel form of the ironclad monitor vessel he was to
    rendezvous with was easily spotted amongst the wooden sailing ships and
    steam-sailers in port. The <emphasis>Heiligerlee</emphasis> was a common
    sight along the coast of Holland so no longer attracted any undue interest
    by arriving in Schveningen.</para>

    <para>The man merged himself with a group of sailors whose direction of
    travel indicated that they were headed in the way he wanted to go. They
    had clearly been ashore for a drink but were not inebriated since this
    would result in being put on a charge as soon as they returned to the
    ship. He joined them in the companionable activity of relieving themselves
    into the dock from the edge of the quay. As he turned inshore, having
    concluded his business, he staggered and went to make a step backwards
    which would have likely precipitated him into the water below. A large,
    calloused hand grasped him firmly under the arms and set him back on the
    right track.</para>

    <para>"Steady as you go, Matey! You'll be for it when the officer on deck
    sees the state you're in!"</para>

    <para>His saviour accompanied him to the foot of the gangway to ensure his
    safety before leaving him to make his slow and unsteady way to the deck at
    the top.</para>

    <para>The <emphasis>Adelborst</emphasis> (Sergeant) on duty was marking
    off the returning crew to make sure no one was missing but stuck his arm
    out when the man reached him thus preventing his further passage onto the
    deck. He had been watching the group of sailors as they drained their
    bilges and had seen this one experiencing heavy weather, rolling
    noticeably and being blown off course from time to time so requiring the
    services of a tug boat in the burley shape of the chief stoker. He reeked
    of alcohol and, when asked his name and rank, was unable to articulate
    more than a slurred mumble. Heaving a sigh of resignation, the
    <emphasis>Adelborst</emphasis> snapped his fingers towards the Master at
    Arms waiting nearby and instructed him to convey the miscreant to the brig
    to sober up and await being brought before the Commander on a
    charge.</para>

    <para>The <emphasis>Heiligerlee</emphasis> had been built with a shallow
    draft of just under 3m, armor plated sides, a low freeboard and armed with
    a few but heavy guns. She was designed to patrol the coast and rivers in
    case of invasion in the aftermath of the Franco-Prussian War. A sturdy and
    useful vessel, she was also the butt of humour because of some rather
    unfortunate 'incidents', running aground between Dordrecht and Rotterdam
    then again in the opposite direction, following this up by hitting a
    bridge on the same route.</para>

    <para>Since the<emphasis> Heiligerlee </emphasis>was only in Scheveningen
    harbour for a few hours, most of her complement of 117 men had stayed on
    board so had not had opportunity to get into trouble, hence the man had
    the brig to himself. A guard had been rustled up to keep and eye on him in
    case he hurt himself or choked on his won vomit, but mostly retreated to a
    discrete hideout where he could smoke, read the racing papers and doze
    noisily. His deception having achieved its objective, the man wrapped
    himself in the single, rough, navy blanket and lay down on the bunk,
    promptly falling into a sound sleep. He was woken by a different guard
    bringing in a tray of breakfast and suggesting that he visit the heads and
    clean himself up before being brought before Luitenant 1e klas W F Meijen.
    The man availed himself of both breakfast and bathroom facilities,
    returning to the brig to find a pile of clean clothes on the bunk.</para>

    <para>The commander dismissed the guard who had escorted the man then
    closed his cabin door. The two men could now talk in private.</para>

    <para>"I was beginning to think that you had missed our rendezvous and I
    had to leave without you. Then a sheepish crewman reported that he thought
    there was a stowaway as he had a supernumerary on his return from shore
    leave list. We have only just left winter quarters in Rotterdam and have
    had a change of about half of the crew since last year so the new names
    and faces are not familiar yet. Hence you had managed to slip past him,
    much to his embarrassment. He sought to redeem himself by having you
    thrown in the brig where I trust you had a restful night."</para>

    <para>The man reassured him that the hotel service on his ship was of an
    acceptable standard!</para>

    <para>"The crewman I sent to you this morning can be trusted to be
    discrete and the chap from last night is too ashamed of himself to spread
    rumours so your stay with us will be as <emphasis>sub Rosa </emphasis>as
    it can be. We are patrolling the coast as normal as we head towards Den
    Helder where we are to drop you off. Currently we are at IJ-Muiden to make
    sure there is nothing untoward happening.</para>

    <para>The heavy excavation work on construction of the North Sea Canal has
    brought in navvies from Germany and Belgium as well as home grown
    <emphasis>polderlarbeiders </emphasis>(polder labourers). There are even
    some English working on the locks, but they tend to keep to themselves.
    Liquor is a problem among the single men in the barracks. Those with
    families tend to accommodate themselves in makeshift huts and holes in the
    ground scattered among the sand dunes. They are more of a cause for
    concern as we have practically no control over them and infiltration would
    be a simple matter for enemy interests. The practice of hiring part of the
    workforce on a daily basis means that strangers can come and go
    practically unnoticed. On top of this there are a lot of fishing boats
    coming off the North Sea for shelter in the estuary and some come to trade
    their catches. Who knows what agents might be coming and going by this sea
    route.</para>

    <para>Not wishing to add to our unfortunate reputation, we have to be wary
    of the sand which accumulates in the harbour despite regular dredging. All
    we can do is send a couple of tenders ashore for a look round and maintain
    a discouraging presence and our ears open for intelligence. Assuming we
    don't encounter any problems, we should be on our way north within the
    hour and anticipate docking in Willemsoord at around half twelve. You are
    welcome to use my cabin until then. Is there anything you need?"</para>

    <para>The man only had one request. More coffee and maybe a
    <emphasis>stroopwaffel</emphasis> for his sweet tooth.</para>

    <para>As the commander made to leave to take his place on the bridge, he
    turned back with a slight twist to his lips;</para>

    <para>"We are about to set the sails to save using the engine which would
    eat into our precious reserves of coal and water. She doesn't sail well
    and we have a beam sea most of the way so you may end up wishing that we
    had missed our rendezvous after all!"</para>

    <para>With that he shut the cabin door behind him leaving the man to
    contemplate how long he would hang on to his breakfast.</para>

    <para>Johan Jacob joined three other men in a small meeting room at the
    Willemsoord naval base. All were in uniform but only one other was a naval
    officer whom Johan Jacob outranked - Just. A rather fearsome looking
    <emphasis>Seargeant</emphasis> from the <emphasis>Korps Mariniers
    </emphasis>(Marines) and a small, wiry chap wearing the unadorned naval
    uniform of a basic <emphasis>Marinier 3e Klasse</emphasis> made up the
    quartet. They were all strangers to one another so sat in silence trying
    to surreptitiously eye each other up. If they were nonplussed so far, they
    were awestruck when they realized that the man who now strode into the
    room sported the <emphasis>Schout-bij-nacht </emphasis>(Rear Admiral)
    uniform. A somewhat lesser ranked man followed in his wake carrying a
    bundle of official-looking document files. The Admiral stamped his
    authority on the briefing by stationing himself behind the lectern at the
    front of the room, drawing himself up to his full height and fixing them
    with a steely glare.</para>

    <para>After a suitable interval to let the room settle and focus their
    attention onto him, he began;</para>

    <para>"Gentlemen. Your country has need of your services on an
    intelligence mission. You will undoubtedly have read in the newspapers or
    heard by word of mouth about the campaign to conquer the
    <emphasis>Sultanaat</emphasis> <emphasis>Atjeh</emphasis> (Sultanate of
    Aceh) on the northern tip of Sumatra in the <emphasis>Oost
    Indische</emphasis> (East Indies). What is known only to a select group,
    of which you will now become members, is that this expedition went even
    more disastrously wrong than is public knowledge."</para>

    <para>Another pause whilst his audience registered their dismay that
    things were even worse than had been commonly understood, which was bad
    enough.</para>

    <para>"Catastrophic mistakes were made for which the commanding officer,
    <emphasis>generaal-majoor</emphasis> Kohler, and eighty of his men paid
    with their lives. <emphasis>Atjeh</emphasis> is of enormous importance to
    our <emphasis>koloniale politik </emphasis><emphasis>van</emphasis>
    <emphasis>uitbreiding</emphasis> (policy of colonial expansion) as it
    represents the last area of Sumatra which remains independent so outside
    of Dutch control. It derives much of its wealth from the growth of the
    pepper spice and, less acceptably, from piracy along its busy coastline.
    The recent discovery of oil fields promises to be of major significance in
    the future and we need these to be a Dutch resource. Incorporating
    <emphasis>Atjeh</emphasis> into the rest of Sumatra, with its proximity to
    Java which is already entirely in Dutch hands, is an objective which must
    be attained.</para>

    <para>Gentlemen, your remit is to ensure that a second expedition does not
    fail. The folders which will bepassed out to you now contain the
    background to the action, descriptions of the action during the first
    expedition and such analysis of its failure as has been made so far.
    Familiarise yourselves with this material. Subject the analysis to
    scrutiny and be ready to advance the understandings it offers.</para>

    <para>You will travel overland to join the <emphasis>Banda</emphasis>, a
    newly commissioned <emphasis>Riouw</emphasis> class gunship, before she
    takes the shortcut through the Suez Canal. From there it is a passage of
    about three weeks to your destination. Once on board you will be furnished
    with the latest dossier and an account of the strategy for the second
    expedition which is under the strictest of security protocols. You will
    then be in a position to identify vital intelligence requirements and to
    formulate plans for gathering and analysing this yourselves.</para>

    <para>I cannot stress enough the need for utmost secrecy, an unfortunate
    consequence of which is that you must in no way communicate anything about
    this mission to anybody and that includes your nearest and dearest whom
    you will not see for several months. Keep all documents safely concealed
    and do not consult them in social spaces as they may be overlooked.</para>

    <para>You have each been selected for your different specialist skills so
    will need to get to know each other and form effective working
    relationships. Once on board you will also receive input on the local
    languages and customs as well as training on covert operations and self
    defence. I'm afraid that you might also be required to cover for crew
    absences as the <emphasis>Banda</emphasis> does not have space to
    accommodate passengers.</para>

    <para>Good luck and God speed."</para>

    <para>With that he strode from the room leaving no opportunity for
    questions.</para>

    <para>The man remaining passed out the files and informed the group that
    they had the rest of the day to retire to their allocated accommodation in
    order to read, digest and comment on the contents before the files had to
    be returned to him;</para>

    <para>"Tomorrow you will be issued with travel documents but your
    itineraries will all be different and you will not be in uniform. These
    measures are to limit the possibility of attracting unwanted attention by
    forming a somewhat unusual group. Any questions?"</para>

    <para>There was just one. The burly marine wanted to know when and where
    there would be food available!</para>

    <para/>

    <para>The odd quartet were next together after boarding the
    <emphasis>Banda </emphasis>where the Commander welcomed them formally with
    drinks in his cabin before dinner. In the interval between the welcome and
    the meal they were suddenly left to their own devices which presented them
    with their first challenge: how to reconcile their differences in rank
    within the strict chain of command which characterises all armed forces
    with the nature of their mission which required their cooperation as
    equals. It was the ordinary seaman who took the initiative by knocking on
    the other three cabin doors to flush out the occupants. He gestured
    towards the lumpy cloth bag he was holding:</para>

    <para>"I stumbled across an unattended bottle of something spiritus. There
    is a round of cheese to go with it which cook didn't seem to be using. All
    we need to get us started are some vessels to drink from and somewhere
    private to relax. I have a knife for the cheese."</para>

    <para>"Just the ticket!"; barked the Marine, ducking back into their
    cabins to round up an assortment of cups and glasses, the dubious
    cleanliness of which was possibly improved by a quick wipe with his
    handkerchief.</para>

    <para>There was a palpable release of collectively held breath as the ice
    was broken and everyone accepted that they were stuck with each other so
    had better get on with it!</para>

    <para>Johan Jacob had occupied himself by memorising the plan of the ship
    so led the way to the commodious linen store where they arranged
    themselves in some comfort amongst the sheets and blankets. The other
    naval man contributed to the proceedings by fabricating a means of
    securing the door against intruders, there being no key for the lock. The
    bottle was broached, the cheese was sliced and a round of introductions
    began. It was quickly agreed that they would only use their shortened
    forenames, partly as a social leveler which would also facilitate
    communication but also because it would impede identification by the enemy
    in clandestine operations. They also agreed that it would be helpful if
    they each gave some account of what they thought were their special
    talents which had got them into this situation.</para>

    <para>Johan Jacob elected to go first, to some extent a vestige of his
    senior rank. He thought of using his nickname amongst his drinking circle,
    'J J' , but decided that too many people would associate that with him
    personally. Instead he chose to be known to the group as 'Jan'. It was
    easy for him to say why he as there as his only talent was that he could
    read the topography of his location and turn it into an accurate map. In
    the reverse direction, he was able to visualise how a map he was reading
    would appear in the flesh, as it were. Since it a well known failing of
    the first campaign was that they attacked a mosque instead mistakenly
    believing it to be the Sultan's palace. To add to the failure of the
    campaign, there were no proper maps of the interior of
    <emphasis>Atjeh</emphasis> where it was as easy for the enemy to disappear
    as it was for their pursuers to get lost. Of course, he would also need to
    teach at least some of the men to actually read his maps if they were to
    do any good!</para>

    <para>" You could do worse than start your lessons with us!"</para>

    <para>This was from the sailor to be known henceforth as 'Piet' . Having
    spoken up, it was natural for him to go next. He thought that the others
    might already have guessed at his 'speciality' from the consumables they
    were enjoying! He was a scavenger who could magic up anything that the
    others required just so long as no questions were asked. This 'talent' had
    got him into enough hot water that he had been given the choice of
    'volunteering' for this mission or being dishonourably discharged.
    Civilian life held no attraction for him so, here he was!</para>

    <para>Completing the trio of Navy men, the last was to be known as 'Cor'.
    He had been trained as an engineer but had become bored with the routine
    of his job. What had emerged was his capacity to invent gadgets and find
    work-around fixes for problems. He confessed that some of his inventions
    had a propensity to self-destruct, especially where electricity was
    involved. But, nothing ventured meant nothing gained and, besides, he
    doubted there would be much electricity in the jungle! The opinion was
    ventured that his positive outlook was also an asset!</para>

    <para>Lastly, 'Klaas' thought that his impressive physical size, which had
    been honed to muscular perfection by his Marine training, had something to
    do with his inclusion. He described himself as a fighter and a tireless
    workhorse. He could also spur others on when fatigue or failing spirits
    set in, erring on the side of bullying if necessary!</para>

    <para>As the level in the bottle dwindled and postures tended more towards
    the horizontal, they began to share servicemen's anecdotes and discover
    some commonalities. A persistent hammering on the door interrupted the
    appreciation of one particularly daring escapade. Once they had gone quiet
    the voice of their steward firmly but politely reminded them that they
    were required to attend for dinner with the Commander in 15 minutes time.
    By the time they had stood up, straightened their clothing and opened the
    door there was no sign of the steward. Whist the others were freshening
    themselves up, Piet discreetly returned the now empty bottle where he had
    found it when full and squirreled away the remains of the cheese for later
    consumption. He just had time to empty his bladder and slick down his hair
    with spit before heading for the Commander's table.</para>

    <para>Dinner was a pleasant affair with good food and genial company.
    Although the wine was consumed with gusto, the cheese board only received
    desultory attention from the quartet. When it came time to depart after
    coffee and cigars, which Piet obtained permission to replace with a
    self-rolled cigarette whilst still managing to 'acquire' the cigar, the
    merry band took a turn around the deck whilst they worked out a plan of
    action for the next day. They had been provided with a program of official
    inputs with the first being instruction on covert intelligence gathering
    which was scheduled for two hours after breakfast every day for the first
    week or so. They needed time to study the material in the new folders
    which they had been given so elected to devote the remaining time before
    luncheon to making a start on that, continuing after the meal. At some
    point there needed to be space for fresh air and exercise, with the
    obvious time being once digestion of their luncheon had taken place but
    before washing and dressing for dinner. The daily conference was best
    served by being open-ended so would be the last item on the agenda.</para>

    <title/>

    <para>When the Commander said that the <emphasis>Banda</emphasis> would
    leave on the first tide next day he failed to disclose that this would be
    just past midnight. No sooner had Jan descended to the depths of a
    dream-laden slumber than the thudding of the pistons and the rattling of
    the mooring lines being winched in suddenly woke him. The noises of
    departure were familiar to him and he registered the changes in engine
    tone and in the motion of the ship until these settled into a pattern
    which told him that they were out at sea and on their way south. Light
    airs kept the ship under power by steam not sail. Calm seas made for a
    gentle motion which soon lulled him back to sleep until the steward roused
    him with hot water for a shave and clean clothes appropriate to the
    informal activities of the coming day.</para>

    <para>Klaas had been startled awake by the sounds of their parting company
    from dry land and had never regained the peace of mind necessary to
    resuming sleep. At breakfast he complained bitterly about the merciless
    seas and his consequent inability to sufficiently refuel his bulk from the
    substantial breakfast fare, the sight of which caused a rebellious streak
    in his stomach. Fortunately for this slightly green man, their tutor for
    that morning's session, who was also an indifferent sailor himself, had
    heeded the sage advice that keeping the horizon in view would be settling
    and chosen a sheltered area of the topsides for their gathering. It didn't
    take the group long to appreciate their tutor's expertise in the area of
    covert operations for it was the man, possibly appearing as himself for
    once.</para>

    <para>The man surveyed the party of men before him and his heart sank as
    he appreciated the obstacles facing them in passing unnoticed among the
    people of Sumatra in their varied environments. The one called Klaas was a
    man mountain with the sandy hair and pink complexion of a Dutch farmer.
    The native population of <emphasis>Atjeh</emphasis> are usually short and
    slight, brown skinned and black haired. Klaas could not be more different
    so there was no chance that he could blend in so the best hope was that he
    possessed good concealment potential. Now Jan was a better prospect as he
    had the right sort of dark, straight hair and a complexion that would tan
    nicely. But, his features were not broad enough and he was far too tall.
    On the other hand, Cor was the right height, if rather too well
    upholstered, and had a round face. If only he could take the good from one
    and add it to the good from another!</para>

    <para>The man's hopes rose with the fourth member of the group, Piet, who
    was quite unremarkable to look at and had a compact and lithe physique.
    This one already had some of the skills which the man was here to develop
    and, of even greater bearing on the matter at hand, he had good instincts.
    The man, who was in the habit of looking out for others of his kind, had
    already taken note of this one as he went about his supposedly clandestine
    pilfering missions so was glad to have him here where his predilections
    could be moulded and channeled to good effect.</para>

    <para>And so to begin their instruction;</para>

    <para>"We will start with the two cardinal rules of concealment: be still
    and be silent."</para>

    <para>With that, the man paused for ten minutes, demonstrating both rules
    to perfection whilst simultaneously observing the others.</para>

    <para>Klaas could manage the still quite well but his ebbuliant nature got
    in the way of keeping quiet as he couldn't control the urge to make
    communicative movements. Cor wasn't doing too badly, once he'd got the
    message that he was supposed to be still and silent. The tall, dark one
    was clearly a quiet man who watched and, maybe, listened rather than
    talked. However, although he probably thought he was completely immobile,
    the rustle of his clothing gave away the small movements of limbs fretting
    at discomfort and inaction. Not a bad start, though. But, the star pupil
    was Piet who cottoned on to what was expected almost immediately,
    remaining both commendably silent and still until his control started to
    slip after seven or eight minutes.</para>

    <para>The man clapped his hands to indicate that the exercise was over,
    making everybody start which provided him with an introduction to the
    necessity of being prepared for the unexpected. Each man was then asked to
    evaluate his own performance with the man reinforcing accurate
    self-perception and adding his own feedback. They also needed to be able
    to keenly observe others. To enable him to assess their initial capacity
    for external focus the man asked the group to repeat the ten minutes of
    still silence but this time try to notice the movements of others. This
    time he suggested that they settle themselves into a comfortable and
    sustainable position before the ten minutes started. Despite this, the
    results were mixed as watching others tended to distract from
    self-control.</para>

    <para>It was impressed upon the group that movement, however slight, was
    easily detected by the human visual system which is geared to spot signs
    of potential danger even when at the very edges of their field of vision.
    The same primed detection system applies to hearing, although this sense
    isn't as acute as vision in humans. The sense of smell even less so, but
    other species had different primary senses and could be every bit as
    lethal the human adversaries whom they were seeking to evade. Of course
    concealment was important, and they would come on to that shortly, but
    even if they got caught out in the open, or with scant cover, still and
    silent were their best friends. Even if they failed to escape detection,
    at least they would give the impression of posing no threat.</para>

    <para>Time for another try which yielded at least some improvement all
    round. The man introduced another element into round four. He had arranged
    with the steward to bring a tray of coffee to the room on his signal.
    Everybody was now getting tired, despite their apparent inactivity, so a
    reviving cup of coffee would be highly desirable. Even without that, the
    bustling steward with his rattling tray would have been distraction
    enough. Klaas attempted to deal with the intrusion by screwing his eyes
    shut only to be informed that this effectively denied him awareness of
    changes in his surroundings which could presage danger. Jan and Cor both
    turned their heads to get a better look when they should have relied on
    peripheral vision and keeping still. The man was sure he heard a
    suppressed groan from Cor. Even Piet succumbed to rustlings. They all had
    to endure a final round of feedback before they were praised for their not
    inconsiderable efforts then rewarded with being left to themselves with
    the tray of coffee.</para>

    <para>This introduction to the preparations for their mission had brought
    it home to Jan that this would involve a not inconsiderable element of
    physical threat. If he had entertained the notion that they were off on
    some sort of schoolboy adventure which would be the stuff of ripping yarns
    when they got back home then he was now starting to be disabused of this
    idea. He had been given plenty of food for thought with more from the
    discussion over coffee. Even deeper thought followed as they adjourned to
    study the new file of material they had been given.</para>
  </section>

    <title/>

    <para>Jan decided that he would lie on his bunk and practice at least
    keeping silent, if not completely still, as he perused the mission papers.
    But first he inspected the lock on his metal cabin trunk for signs of
    tampering, relieved to see that there were none. Then he retrieved the
    folder from its hiding place within, checking that there were no
    indications that it had been discovered. Settling himself comfortably, he
    made a quick survey of the contents, which seemed to be assembled in
    roughly chronological order and to add little to the material they had
    already seen. On top, however, were some maps and it was these that
    attracted his immediate attention.</para>

    <para>The first map was intended to educate the geographically ignorant as
    to where Sumatra was, which is to say half a world away from Holland. The
    coastlines of Europe, Russia, Africa, China, the Ottoman Empire, Arabia,
    India, Ceylon, Asia and Indonesia were crudely drawn. The positions of
    their point of departure from Holland, their intermediate ports of call
    and of the Island of Sumatra, just pinpricks on such a large scale map yet
    were boldly marked by sizeable red dots. A solid ink line rather
    simplistically marked the sea route they were to take on the
    <emphasis>Banda</emphasis>. He knew that this took them through the new
    Suez Canal which avoided the long route down the the coast of Africa,
    round the Cape of Good Hope, back north to Madagscar then a long sea leg
    across the Indian Ocean. He had never been to the East Indies before, only
    the West Indies and around Europe, so he was both excited at sailing new
    waters and frustrated at the quality of the cartography in front of him.
    In particular, he was keen to see the Suez Canal which promised to be
    rather different from the Dutch canals he had grown up with. He would ask
    the Captain if he might be allowed to observe from the bridge for this
    part of their voyage.</para>

    <para>Moving on to the next map, he found a rendition of the islands of
    Java and Sumatra along with the mainland beside Java and the small islands
    off the coast of Sumatra. The next map was a closer look at
    <emphasis>Atjeh</emphasis> itself. Jan couldn't stop himself breaking his
    silence with a loud groan. The names of key places were not the same on
    both maps! A closer inspection revealed that the places were not
    identically located either! What was going on! Another trip to the bridge
    in order look at the charts held there was in order as he was going to
    have to make his own map from all available information and his own skill
    at resolving the discrepancies. Once they arrived at their destination he
    would have to take his own exact observations.</para>

    <para>A break for lunch calmed him down and cleared his head ready to
    tackle the written material. Not the best of scholars, he found the
    summary of the history of the Dutch in the East Indies too dry for his
    liking and had only skimmed through it last time. That would have to do!
    Instead he focused on material which seemed to him to be more to the
    point. The recent hostilities perplexed him as he read about an
    Anglo-Dutch 1824 treaty which guaranteed <emphasis>Atjeh's
    </emphasis>independence from the colonial aspirations of those two
    nations. Rather confusingly, more recent agreements between Britain and
    the Netherlands came into force in February 1872 in which continued
    tensions between the two countries were resolved by a swap of Dutch
    possessions on the Gold Coast of Africa for the British withdrawing their
    interests in the island of Sumatra. On the face of it, Sumatra now came
    under Dutch control in its entirety with the proviso that they stopped the
    pirate attacks on British shipping passing through the straights of
    Messina. Being no stranger to the mapping of territorial disputes, Jan
    could see the contradiction between granting <emphasis>Atjeh</emphasis>
    implied sovereignty and Dutch colonial policy and wondered what was going
    on.</para>

    <para>The question was: what tipped this contradiction in control of
    <emphasis>Atjeh</emphasis> over into armed conflict in early 1873? The
    answer, he discovered, was dubbed '<emphasis>het verraad van
    Singapore</emphasis>' (The Singapore betrayal) in January of that year
    when the <emphasis>Atjeneese</emphasis> met delegations from Italy and the
    US in Singapore to explore new bilateral treaties. The delegation from
    <emphasis>Atjeh</emphasis> included the warlors Panglima and Shabander
    Tiban Mohammed, admiral of port rights, as well as the Sultanate's consul,
    so they clearly meant business. Had any such arrangement come to fruition
    then the Dutch would find the door slammed in their face at the
    <emphasis>Atjeh</emphasis> border.</para>

    <para>Now the reading material consisted of bundles of letters and minutes
    of meetings as the politics behind the war got under way. The material at
    least covered the reasoning on the Dutch side. Jan was to some extent
    familiar with the machinations of power and control through his brother's
    involvement in politics, if only on a local and national scale. He had
    always found all that playing with words and the use of manipulation not
    to his taste. He could never quite follow what was going on or determine
    where the truth lay. Duty commenced to fight for his attention with the
    anticipation of boredom.</para>

    <para>To his relief, he was spared the resolution of his dilemma as to
    whether or not read any more of the documents by a knock on the door. When
    he opened it he found Piet sporting a pair of knee length, tropical shorts
    which had been bleached and starched to within an inch of their life then
    ironed flat so that they stood out on either side of his slender legs. His
    outfit was topped off with a pair of grubby white deck shoes and an almost
    white white vest. The little man was energetically running on the spot
    with a huge grin on his face. Surely those shorts must be chafing! Jan
    wilted in the face of so much energy.</para>

    <para>"Exercise time, sir!"</para>

    <para>Jan shut the door on him and leaned back against it but this only
    brought a renewed barrage on the outside. With a groan, he accepted his
    fate and rummaged in his sea chest for more modest but suitable attire,
    not forgetting to secure the file he had been reading. He was further
    urged on by a chorus of encouragement from the other two who had now
    joined Piet but were restraining themselves to verbal exercise rather than
    any actual jumping about.</para>

    <para>Exercise, as envisaged by Piet, consisted of running circuits round
    the deck but, since <emphasis>Banda</emphasis> was only 42 metres long and
    8.4 metres wide at her extremities, this hardly amounted to a marathon. To
    extend their circuit, they toured the internal companionways and gangways,
    getting in everybody's way and attracting a quantity of specialist naval
    language. Clearly they needed a better plan! Jan suggested climbing one of
    the masts but when it came to it nobody was very keen, especially since
    the ship had started to move with the waves as the wind picked up, causing
    the masts to sway rather alarmingly. This did not deter the crew who had
    been dispatched to raise the sails and the group once more found
    themselves chastised for being under foot.</para>

    <para>The agenda for their post prandial meeting in the linen store was a
    comprehensive one as it involved reviewing the morning's lesson in
    concealment, the clear need for a practical fitness regime and the pooling
    their mental resources to make sense of the documents they had been given.
    Nobody but Jan had paid much heed to the maps so his contribution was
    clear. Klaas volunteered his marine training experience to work out a
    series of physical exercises which did not need much space to perform but
    would ensure that all the major muscle groups of the body could be kept in
    peak working order. He admitted that he could see no way to inculcate the
    sort of fitness which comes from route marches or cross-country runs but
    maybe they would be able to get ashore when <emphasis>Banda</emphasis>
    stopped along the way to take on coal, water and fresh food.</para>

    <para>When the discussion got round to the piles of papers, nobody had
    been able to give them their full attention. Piet shamefacedly admitted
    that he wasn't; "much of a one for reading" but, in an attempt to
    compensate he asked that everyone give him a list of things they required
    so that he might make efforts to supply them by one means or another. Cor
    had been the only one to engage with the bundle having surveyed its
    contents and determined that they could be roughly grouped and suggested
    that dividing these amongst the group might conquer the task. He suggested
    that he and Jan take the first shift as the others already had immediate
    tasks. Jan outlined his understanding of the conflict ensuing from the
    treaties which prompted Cor to express a negative view of the actual
    impact of these pieces of diplomatic paper. He had moved on to the
    correspondence and divided the letters into two piles: those between the
    Governor General of the East Indies, J Louden, and the Ministry of
    Colonies back in the Hague; and those between the Commissary for Aceh, FN
    Nieuwenhuijzen, and the Sultan of Aceh. Jan volunteered for the former,
    leaving Cor with the <emphasis>Atjeh</emphasis> end of things.</para>

    <para>This first day established the pattern of the days to follow, unless
    the weather or necessity to perform crewing duties interfered with the
    programme. They had developed their skills at covert operations, which
    included silent methods of dispatching intrusive enemy personnel and life
    threatening wildlife, as far as each of them was able. They had also
    adopted an exercise routine which had attracted the attention of some of
    the officers and crew who asked if they could join in so Klaas found
    himself instructing groups in addition to his team mates.</para>

    <para>As the bottle of whatever-it-was- that-day made the it's rounds
    during the regular linen store conferences a digest of the documentation
    emerged. Cor and Jan reviewed the content of the letters they had read. It
    was no surprise that the powers that be in Den Haag decided that such
    disregard for the 1872 treaty could not be tolerated. To the group's
    dismay, a punitive expedition was ordered with the aim of conquering the
    Sultanate once and for all. Although he had never been to the East Indies,
    Jan had been to the colonies of the West Indies during his naval service
    and knew just how distanced the government in Den Haag was from the
    realities of life so far away.</para>

    <para/>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title/>

    <para>Port Said was their first opportunity to go ashore whilst the ship
    was taking advantage of the world's largest coal bunkering station in the
    world. Passage through the canal required a measure of bureaucracy with
    the accompanying handing over of quantities of cash which included a
    charge for a pilot who actually spent most of his time aboard depleting
    the ship's food stores and snoring loudly in the Captain's chair.</para>

    <para>In the event, The Suez Canal proved rather disappointing for Jan.
    There were no locks and much of it ran dead straight between largely sandy
    vistas only broken by the higher Sinai lands to he east and a few
    makeshift towns associated with the canal construction. The only bends
    encountered were there simply to ease the route the canal by passing it
    through a number of existing lakes which added little interest to the
    landscape or challenge to the navigator. To add to the tedium, their
    forty-hour long transit included a lengthy spell hove too in the passing
    place waiting for an oncoming vessel to clear their onward channel since
    only one way traffic was allowed and the canal wasn't busy enough for
    organised convoys to be utilised.</para>

    <para>By contrast, the approach to their next landfall at the port of
    Galle on the south west corner of the coast of Ceylon was stunning. The
    Dutch Fort with it's stark white lighthouse was their first sight of the
    coast being built on a rocky peninsula jutting out from the mainland. The
    fort owed its name to the impregnable fortifications constructed by the
    Dutch during the period of their control between Portuguese and British
    administrations. Granite and coral had been brought for the construction
    of encircling walls with multiple bastions and a sea wall which made a
    formidable sight when approached by sea on a sunny day. The
    <emphasis>Banda </emphasis>passed to the east of these formidable walls as
    she made her way into the natural harbour under its protection. Jan noted
    the number of wrecks of ships which had fallen foul of the rocks and
    shallows marked on the chart. Arriving on the bridge he found a pilot
    guide open by the helm which indicated their safe approach using a flag
    pole and the characteristic hump of the 'Hooiberg' Hay Cock. Since the
    weather was good and the <emphasis>Banda</emphasis> under steam, the
    Captain didn't signal for a pilot to come out to steer the ship and Jan
    hoped that he could trust the Captain's skill to see them safely anchored
    amongst the other ships waiting for a vacant jetty, preferably one near to
    the watering place and in the best shelter on the eastern side of the
    bay.</para>

    <para>This was to be a busy interlude for the crew but Jan and his
    colleagues were granted time to go shore with a tender lowered to convey
    them there. Being rather sated of each other's company by now, Jan elected
    to make a solo expedition to the Dutch Fort which he approached along the
    beach which lined the bay beyond the harbour area. This brought him to the
    old gate through the defensive wall across the neck of the peninsular.
    Once inside, he wandered the narrow streets which made him feel nostalgic
    for home as the architecture showed a heavily Dutch influence. Both
    domestic and commercial buildings showed their origins in the heyday of
    the VOC (Dutch East India Comany) and there was even a Dutch Reformed
    Church, the <emphasis>Groote Kerk</emphasis>. </para>

    <para>Jan came across the imposing New Orient Hotel, once the Dutch
    Governor's Residence, perched above the eastern ramparts and decided that
    it was time to slake his thirst and to see what food might be on offer. He
    headed across the street to the entrance portaco which pierced the shade
    of the veranda. He found himself in a huge, high-ceilinged <emphasis>Zaal
    </emphasis>(entrance hall) off which he could see several large rooms and
    a grand staircase. His rather halting attempt at English apparently
    identified him as Dutch and he was thenceforth addressed in his own
    language, the hotel staff being well versed in making guests from all over
    Europe feel at ease. He was given directions to the bar and the dining
    room. Although drawn to the buzz of social life coming from the bar, he
    elected to eat firsts so took a seat at one of the dining tables where he
    was immediately presented with a menu listing so many dishes from various
    cuisines that he was paralysed by the choice. He eventually selected a
    couple of French dishes whose names he recognised, the execution of which
    had a decidedly oriental twist, and ate his fill with enjoyment and
    appreciation of the change from navy rations.</para>

    <para>Making his way to the bar, Jan soon fell in with another Dutchman
    who was something administrative and a local resident. Already being a few
    drinks ahead of Jan, his new friend was glad to share his local knowledge
    with a newly arrived fellow countryman. Galle, it seemed, was on the
    skids. The good people of Columbo had decided to demolish their equivalent
    of the Dutch Fort and build extensive breakwaters in order to create a
    vast port with more shelter and better facilities than Galle. It was
    becoming evident that Galle's trade was being stolen by the new harbour at
    Columbo. Passenger ships coming from Europe, India and even Australia were
    still using Galle, but the merchant and military traffic was dwindling.
    The undoubted charms of Galle were preferable to the noisy commerce of
    Columbo, which could, in any case, be visited for the day by means of a
    good road link. Jan's increasingly lugubrious companion feared for his
    livelihood and the loss of his comfortable, if informal, domestic
    arrangements.</para>

    <para>As the day wore on and the alcohol flowed, the atmosphere in the now
    crowded bar became increasingly rowdy until a scuffle started which
    threatened to turn into a full scale fight between French sailors and
    Irish longshoremen. Jan's Dutch companion seemed unmoved by the ruckus,
    implying that such things were not unusual. The barman soon defused the
    situation by ejecting both ringleaders by the application of expert force.
    It seemed that beneath the gentile ambiance of this distinguished
    establishment there ran murkier currents.</para>
