    <para>The man had been covertly watching Van der Boschstraat 12 for
    several days waiting for a chance to catch Johan Jacob alone but the woman
    of the house had shown no inclination to go out. Johan Jacob could be seen
    in his workroom, presumably pouring over his maps upon the hour rather
    than venturing beyond his front door. It was, of course, only a matter of
    time before he answered the call of the ladies available to cater to his
    less cerebral needs. It was a pity that such a sojourn would likely take
    place during the evening which fact meant that the man had to suffer the
    volatile weather of the spring season with only some slight benefit of the
    cover of darkness at later hours. He had to suffer everything from being
    warmed by blinding sunshine to attacked by hail and sleet borne on a the
    winds of a squally. It was a challenge to his pride to maintain his
    reputation for inconspicuousness under such conditions, especially in the
    barrenness of a street of newly built villas. This particular day had
    begun with those wealthy enough to have the choice out for a stroll to
    enjoy the chirruping of the birdies and surging of sap in the flora whilst
    their servants headed along the street with more purpose, either real or
    invented. Although at pains to dress appropriately for the weather and
    change his general appearance frequently, regulars might begin to sense
    something familiar about him and slow movers have the time to take him in.
    A sudden, spring shower late in the afternoon drove everybody indoors -
    and soaked him to the skin! Fresh, dry clothes and novel ways to conceal
    himself had to be brought into play. Fortunately, activities above and
    below stairs relating to the ritual of dinner kept most folk off the
    street and away from the windows.</para>

    <para>Now the weather had cleared up to reveal an almost full moon and
    brilliant with stars. Very nice and all that but the increased
    illumination made remaining invisible difficult yet again added to which
    the temperature was plummeting towards a late frost. His cold, wet feet
    were starting to go numb but stamping some life and warmth back into them
    risked giving himself away to any nosey busybody. His damp clothes were
    steaming dry but taking the heat from his body with them and a drip was
    forming on the end of his nose. </para>

    <para>Ah, but look here! The front door was opening and, yes, the familiar
    figure of his quarry was emerging from it! The man quietly slipped onto
    the pavement behind Johan Jacob and followed him to a distance safely out
    of view from the house before he took a small, round stone from his pocket
    and lobbed it at Johan Jacob's shoulder. Without breaking his stride,
    Johan Jacob walked on then suddenly diverged from his route and stopped in
    the concealing shelter of a low hanging tree. The man walked past, looking
    and listening, before satisfying himself that they were alone and turning
    back to also duck under the dripping willow branches where Johan Jacob was
    waiting expectantly.</para>

    <para>"Your taking ship for Sumatra, first tide, day after tomorrow. Go in
    uniform but take informal tropical clothing. We will sort you out some
    better gear when you get there. So, travel light and with concealed small
    arms . You'll be away months rather than weeks. Questions? "</para>

    <para>Johan Jacob stared thoughtfully at his shoes then nodded his head to
    accept the brief before adding,</para>

    <para>"Then I had better make haste and take full use of the delights at
    my destination."</para>

    <para>With that, he turned on his heel and strode off into the
    night.</para>

    <para>The man waited until the footsteps had died away before peering
    through the drooping willow branches to ensure that the coast was He
    quietly took himself off in the direction of the less salubrious parts of
    Den Haag where he would not attract attention in a smoke-filled bar which
    specialised in cheap <emphasis>jenever</emphasis>. The result of his
    efforts to reheat through the ingestion of rough spirit was that pretty
    much all of him not just his extremities, was pleasantly anaesthetized by
    the time he set out for the docks at Scheveningen. He had also contrived
    to spill most of his last <emphasis>shot jenever</emphasis> down his
    front, which was a waste! Luckily the novel form of the ironclad monitor
    vessel he was to rendezvous with was easily spotted amongst the wooden
    sailing ships and steam-sailers in port. The
    <emphasis>Heiligerlee</emphasis> was a common sight along the coast of
    Holland so attracted no longer attracted any undue interest by arriving in
    Schveningen.</para>

    <para>The man merged himself with a group of sailors whose direction of
    travel indicated that they were headed in the way he wanted to go. They
    had clearly been ashore for a drink but were not inebriated since this
    would result on being put on a charge as soon as they returned to the
    ship. He joined them in the companionable activity of relieving themselves
    into the dock from the edge of the quay. As he turned inshore, having
    concluded his business, he staggered and went to make a step backwards
    which would have likely precipitated him into the water below. A large,
    calloused hand grasped him firmly under the arms and set him back on the
    right track.</para>

    <para>"Steady as you go, Matey! You'll be for it when the officer on deck
    sees the state you're in!"</para>

    <para>His saviour accompanied him to the foot of the gangway to ensure his
    safety before leaving him to make his slow and unsteady way to the deck at
    the top.</para>

    <para>The <emphasis>Adelborst</emphasis> (or Sergeant) on duty was marking
    off the returning crew to make sure no one was missing but stuck his arm
    out when the man reached him thus preventing his further passage onto the
    deck. He had been watching the group of sailors as they drained their
    bilges and had seen this one experiencing heavy weather, rolling
    noticeably and being blown off course from time to time so requiring the
    services of a tug boat in the burley shape of the chief stoker. He reeked
    of alcohol and, when asked his name and rank, was unable to articulate
    more than a slurred mumble. Heaving a sigh of resignation, the
    <emphasis>Adelborst</emphasis> snapped his fingers towards the Master at
    Arms waiting nearby and instructed him to convey the miscreant to the brig
    to sober up and await being brought before the Commander on a
    charge.</para>

    <para>Since the<emphasis> Heiligerlee </emphasis>was only in harbour for a
    few hours, most of her complement of 117 men had stayed on board so had
    not had opportunity to get into trouble, hence the man had th e brig to
    himself. A guard had been rustled up to keep and eye on him in case he
    hurt himself or choked on his won vomit, but mostly retreat to a discrete
    hideout where he could smoke, read the racing papers and doze noisily. His
    deception having achieved its objective, the man wrapped himself in the
    single, rough, navy blanket and lay down on the bunk, promptly falling
    into a sound sleep. He was woken by a different guard bringing in a tray
    of breakfast and suggesting that he visit the heads and clean himself up
    before being brought before Luitenant 1e klas W F Meijen.</para>

    <para>Having availed himself of a free night's bed and breakfast, the man
    shed the status of 'on a charge' as soon as the commander dismissed the
    guard and closed his cabin door behind him. The two men could now talk in
    private. Lt Meijen passed across a sealed envelope which the man opened,
    read then used the available lucifer and metal ashtray to burn it. There
    was a pensive silence on the part of the man, broken by the Commander's
    enquiry;</para>

    <para>"Where to?"</para>

    <para>The <emphasis>Heiligerlee</emphasis> had been built with a shallow
    draft of just under 3m, armor plated sides, a low freeboard and armed with
    a few but heavy guns. She was designed to patrol the coast and rivers in
    case of invasion in the aftermath of the Franco-Prussian War. A study and
    useful vessel, she was also the butt of humour because of some rather
    unfortunate 'incidents', running aground between Dordrecht and Rotterdam
    then again in the opposite direction, next she hit a bridge on the same
    route. The threat of invasion had receded so she was hardly busy and was
    due to over winter in Rotterdam, but first was to convey her supernumerary
    crew member to his next covert job.</para>

    <para>Now the difficulties for Theodorus and Cornelis started. The
    <emphasis>gang</emphasis> was the hub of the house so still constantly in
    use by men working on the upstairs rooms yet time needed to be devoted to
    getting it ready for the grand event in August. This meant that all of the
    upstairs rooms which would be needed had to be given priority now so that
    they, too, could be sealed off whilst the central
    <emphasis>gang</emphasis> , <emphasis>trappenhuis</emphasis>, or
    staircase, and <emphasis>witte overloop</emphasis>, or white landing, were
    decorated. Then, working forwards, the ground floor family rooms must be
    completed, not to mention laying the groundwork for a working kitchen. All
    of this must be made ready in time for carpets to be laid, curtains hung,
    furniture placed, and all the many objects put on display. The only slight
    relief to this immense schedule of work was the decision by the family not
    to use part of the house. Paulina and her husband would be returning to
    their own house to sleep so the upstairs suite of rooms behind the
    carefully installed<emphasis> witte bovenportaal</emphasis>, or white
    screen and door, would not be needed. Also, since Marcellus was not the
    host but the guest of honour, the formal <emphasis>grote salon</emphasis>
    and <emphasis>eetkamer, </emphasis>or dining room, intended as function
    rooms would not be needed either. Already these rooms had been tidied and
    cleaned with the workmen redeployed to other parts of the house.</para>

    <para>The situation which had been the trigger for the heated exchange
    between Theodorus and Cornelis earlier in the day now had to be addressed.
    The area of the house into which a full compliment of existing men plus
    the new workers drafted in that day had to operate was drastically
    reduced. The men themselves had instituted a system of entering by the
    kitchen door and exiting through the garden room door after several
    collisions and hold ups had frustrated tempers and damaged goods. This had
    not solved all of their issues as conflicts over who was doing what and
    where had proliferated. Theodorus recognised that he needed to manage the
    situation by allocating specific jobs to men and making sure that they
    were making due progress, reviewing the whole effort on at least a daily
    basis and adjusting deployments as necessary. He needed Cornelis to
    contribute to the identification of what needed to be done and to apply
    his knowledge of the men's capabilities to their allocation. The two men
    needed to be sure that they didn't contradict each other in directing the
    work yet dividing the overseeing between them to keep things in manageable
    proportions.</para>

    <para>Theodorus was to take charge of the plasterwork and Cornelis the
    woodwork, that much was easy to decide as it played to their specialities.
    How to apportion the painters needed some consideration as both
    plasterwork and woodwork needed painting. However, there was painting and
    then there was painting. Applying base coats of paint required minimal
    skill. Colouring large areas of plain plaster on walls and ceilings
    required enough skill to give an even finish. Similarly smaller but plain
    sections of woodwork, such as doors and skirtings. Then there was carved
    wood and simple plaster mouldings needing care but not the skilled
    brushwork of intricate carvings and mouldings, especially where a steady
    hand and narrow brush were involved. Then there were the special
    techniques involved in imitating marble and different types of wood. These
    later stages of decoration needed carefully arranged drying times to cope
    with the application of different colours and finishes.</para>

    <para>The planned use of rooms in the house during Marcellus's day of
    celebration was to begin with entry by the front door, passing through to
    the vestibule and from thence into the <emphasis>kleine salon</emphasis>
    where refreshments were to be served. When the
    <emphasis>Burgermeester</emphasis> was called to join the celebrations in
    his honour, he and his guests would pass through to the
    <emphasis>gang</emphasis> (making use, if necessary, of the modern toilet
    with its wooden casing wide enough to accommodate the ladies' vast skirts,
    marble walls and flushing bowl), ascend the
    <emphasis>trappenhuis</emphasis> to the <emphasis>witte
    overloop</emphasis> and from there into a small room that led out onto the
    balcony above the front door where Marcellus would stand to view the
    entertainments. Since the balcony itself was quite small, guests could
    also view proceedings from one of the large windows from a narrow gallery
    above the staircase. These areas of the house had to be ready in time and
    completed to the highest possible standard to honour Marcellus. Also, the
    <emphasis>burgermeester </emphasis>needed to be sure that his guests were
    sufficiently impressed in order to vindicate his decision to build a new
    house.</para>

    <para>Out of the eyes of all but his closest family (and servants), the
    <emphasis>Burgermeeseter's</emphasis> private chambers led off the
    <emphasis>witte overloop</emphasis> through a frosted glazed door and
    screen, white on one side to match the entrance to Paulina's quarters
    opposite and brown on the other to follow the theme of Marcellus's rooms.
    Beyond this entrance lay a central hall the eponymous <emphasis>bruine
    overloop</emphasis> or brown hall. A door on the left leading towards the
    front of the house gave into Marcellus's bedroom and thence to his
    dressing room and the innovation of a bathroom. It was expected that
    Marcellus would spend at his first night here following his anniversary
    celebrations so these rooms also needed to be prepared to at least as high
    a standard as the areas of the house on general view. This was the most
    challenging part of the whole construction project, especially the bedroom
    where the <emphasis>Burgermeester</emphasis> had given his taste for the
    trappings of position and wealth full rein.</para>

    <para>The imposing grey and red marble fireplace ensemble filled the space
    between floor and ceiling in the centre of the west wall. The ornate
    carvings of the sections above and below the mirror had survived
    relocation without cracks, chips or any more significant damage thanks to
    careful packing in fine cotton gauze, straw and sacking before being
    crated up. The less ornate sections had also been wrapped and crated in
    straw, but this had been a simpler task. The huge mirror with its curved
    shaping top and bottom had been similarly stored with great care, as had
    its delicate wooden mounting frame. Everyone concerned with installing the
    whole ensemble in its new location breathed a sigh of relief when this had
    been safely accomplished. Only one alteration had been required being the
    relatively straightforward job of taking a bit off the bottom of the
    pillars either side of the fire grate which had originally been taller
    and, some said, in better balance with the mirror section.</para>

    <para>Cornelis Straver and his team of craftsmen could then finish
    installing the Mahogany wood paneling which Marcellus had commissioned. He
    had specified that all of the woodwork be in the 18th Century French
    Regency style, which had sent Cornelis scurrying off to France on a visit
    to the grand palaces of Verssailes and Fontainbleau to see for himself the
    sort of thing Marcellus had in mind. The delicate, curving shapes of the
    panels which edged the ceiling, rather than plaster cornicing, were
    something different from the rest of the house and presented Cornelis with
    an enjoyable challenge to his skill. Theodorus might have felt he got off
    lightly as the plasterwork in this chamber consisted of one, large and
    very smooth area on the ceiling and another small oval above the entry
    door. However, he then had the nightmare of finding a artist who was more
    than competent to execute the swirling skies and cavorting angels which
    continued the French theme on these flat areas of plaster. It was
    something of a relief that the plain wall areas inside their rectilinear
    wooden frames were more simply decorated. in plain, dark green with
    delicate, gold leaf tracery borders.</para>

    <para>Not only had Marcellus given himself a stylish bedroom but also the
    luxury of a separate dressing room, the only one in the house. As was the
    bathroom leading from it, equipped with running hot and cold water and a
    zinc bath tub. The hot water had to be pumped up from the well under the
    kitchen terrace and heated in a geyser. The cold water was collected
    rainwater from the roof then held in a reservoir tank in the attic above.
    This arrangement gave sufficient pressure to work the taps and toilet
    flushes. He had done himself proud but not extended his largess to the
    quarters for his daughter and her husband, which were more conventional
    although they could not be describes as spartan by any stretch of the
    imagination. Nor were the meeting room and guest bedroom beyond which were
    accessed through the door off the <emphasis>bruine overloop</emphasis>
    towards the back of the house as luxurious as Marcellus's chambers,
    although he had insisted that the family crests were prominent in the
    decor.</para>

    <para>On a more domestic note, the downstairs <emphasis>huiskamer
    </emphasis>where Marcellus and his family could sit and could take their
    meals once he was in residence, needed to be available for use. Since the
    celebration was to be in late August and some further weeks of fine
    weather were anticipated, the adjacent <emphasis>tuinkamer</emphasis>, or
    garden room, leading through huge, glass doors to a covered terrace and
    riverside garden beyond should be tidied for use by restless guests. By
    the end of their deliberations, Thoedorus and Cornelis had produced a
    daunting schedule of work and were rather down hearted to realise that
    they would not be able to rest on their laurels after the celebrations as
    much would still remain to be done and with the added complication of the
    master being in residence from time to time when not away on business or
    political involvement. Noise and mess would need to be kept to a minimum
    when Marcellus was home.</para>
