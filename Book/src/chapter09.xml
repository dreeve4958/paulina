    <para>The man had been covertly watching Van der Boschstraat 12 for
    several days waiting for a chance to catch Johan Jacob alone but the woman
    of the house had shown no inclination to go out. Johan Jacob could be seen
    in his workroom, presumably pouring over his maps upon the hour rather
    than venturing beyond his front door. It was, of course, only a matter of
    time before he answered the call of the ladies available to cater to his
    less cerebral needs. It was a pity that such a sojourn would likely take
    place during the evening which fact meant that the man had to suffer the
    volatile weather of the spring season with only some slight benefit of the
    cover of darkness at later hours. He had to suffer everything from being
    warmed by blinding sunshine to attacked by hail and sleet borne on a the
    winds of a squally. It was a challenge to his pride to maintain his
    reputation for inconspicuousness under such conditions, especially in the
    barrenness of a street of newly built villas. This particular day had
    begun with those wealthy enough to have the choice out for a stroll to
    enjoy the chirruping of the birdies and surging of sap in the flora whilst
    their servants headed along the street with more purpose, either real or
    invented. Although at pains to dress appropriately for the weather and
    change his general appearance frequently, regulars might begin to sense
    something familiar about him and slow movers have the time to take him in.
    A sudden, spring shower late in the afternoon drove everybody indoors -
    and soaked him to the skin! Fresh, dry clothes and novel ways to conceal
    himself had to be brought into play. Fortunately, activities above and
    below stairs relating to the ritual of dinner kept most folk off the
    street and away from the windows.</para>

    <para>Now the weather had cleared up to reveal an almost full moon and
    brilliant with stars. Very nice and all that but the increased
    illumination made remaining invisible difficult yet again added to which
    the temperature was plummeting towards a late frost. His cold, wet feet
    were starting to go numb but stamping some life and warmth back into them
    risked giving himself away to any nosey busybody. His damp clothes were
    steaming dry but taking the heat from his body with them and a drip was
    forming on the end of his nose.</para>

    <para>Ah, but look here! The front door was opening and, yes, the familiar
    figure of his quarry was emerging from it! The man quietly slipped onto
    the pavement behind Johan Jacob and followed him to a distance safely out
    of view from the house before he took a small, round stone from his pocket
    and lobbed it at Johan Jacob's shoulder. Without breaking his stride,
    Johan Jacob walked on then suddenly diverged from his route and stopped in
    the concealing shelter of a low hanging tree. The man walked past, looking
    and listening, before satisfying himself that they were alone and turning
    back to also duck under the dripping willow branches where Johan Jacob was
    waiting expectantly.</para>

    <para>"You will be taking ship for Sumatra and must report for briefing at
    1600 the day after tomorrow. Go in uniform but take informal tropical
    clothing. We will sort you out some better gear when you get there. So,
    travel light and with concealed small arms . You'll be away months rather
    than weeks. Questions? "</para>

    <para>Johan Jacob stared thoughtfully at his shoes then nodded his head to
    accept the brief before adding,</para>

    <para>"Then I had better make haste and take full use of the delights at
    my destination."</para>

    <para>With that, he turned on his heel and strode off into the
    night.</para>

    <para>The man waited until the footsteps had died away before peering
    through the drooping willow branches to ensure that the coast was He
    quietly took himself off in the direction of the less salubrious parts of
    Den Haag where he would not attract attention in a smoke-filled bar which
    specialised in cheap <emphasis>jenever</emphasis>. The result of his
    efforts to reheat through the ingestion of rough spirit was that pretty
    much all of him not just his extremities, was pleasantly anaesthetized by
    the time he set out for the docks at Scheveningen. He had also contrived
    to spill most of his last <emphasis>shot jenever</emphasis> down his
    front, which was a waste! Luckily the novel form of the ironclad monitor
    vessel he was to rendezvous with was easily spotted amongst the wooden
    sailing ships and steam-sailers in port. The
    <emphasis>Heiligerlee</emphasis> was a common sight along the coast of
    Holland so attracted no longer attracted any undue interest by arriving in
    Schveningen.</para>

    <para>The man merged himself with a group of sailors whose direction of
    travel indicated that they were headed in the way he wanted to go. They
    had clearly been ashore for a drink but were not inebriated since this
    would result on being put on a charge as soon as they returned to the
    ship. He joined them in the companionable activity of relieving themselves
    into the dock from the edge of the quay. As he turned inshore, having
    concluded his business, he staggered and went to make a step backwards
    which would have likely precipitated him into the water below. A large,
    calloused hand grasped him firmly under the arms and set him back on the
    right track.</para>

    <para>"Steady as you go, Matey! You'll be for it when the officer on deck
    sees the state you're in!"</para>

    <para>His saviour accompanied him to the foot of the gangway to ensure his
    safety before leaving him to make his slow and unsteady way to the deck at
    the top.</para>

    <para>The <emphasis>Adelborst</emphasis> (or Sergeant) on duty was marking
    off the returning crew to make sure no one was missing but stuck his arm
    out when the man reached him thus preventing his further passage onto the
    deck. He had been watching the group of sailors as they drained their
    bilges and had seen this one experiencing heavy weather, rolling
    noticeably and being blown off course from time to time so requiring the
    services of a tug boat in the burley shape of the chief stoker. He reeked
    of alcohol and, when asked his name and rank, was unable to articulate
    more than a slurred mumble. Heaving a sigh of resignation, the
    <emphasis>Adelborst</emphasis> snapped his fingers towards the Master at
    Arms waiting nearby and instructed him to convey the miscreant to the brig
    to sober up and await being brought before the Commander on a
    charge.</para>

    <para>The <emphasis>Heiligerlee</emphasis> had been built with a shallow
    draft of just under 3m, armor plated sides, a low freeboard and armed with
    a few but heavy guns. She was designed to patrol the coast and rivers in
    case of invasion in the aftermath of the Franco-Prussian War. A sturdy and
    useful vessel, she was also the butt of humour because of some rather
    unfortunate '<emphasis>incidents</emphasis>', running aground between
    Dordrecht and Rotterdam then again in the opposite direction, following
    this up by hitting a bridge on the same route.</para>

    <para>Since the<emphasis> Heiligerlee </emphasis>was only in Scheveningen
    harbour for a few hours, most of her complement of 117 men had stayed on
    board so had not had opportunity to get into trouble, hence the man had
    the brig to himself. A guard had been rustled up to keep and eye on him in
    case he hurt himself or choked on his won vomit, but mostly retreat to a
    discrete hideout where he could smoke, read the racing papers and doze
    noisily. His deception having achieved its objective, the man wrapped
    himself in the single, rough, navy blanket and lay down on the bunk,
    promptly falling into a sound sleep. He was woken by a different guard
    bringing in a tray of breakfast and suggesting that he visit the heads and
    clean himself up before being brought before Luitenant 1e klas W F Meijen.
    The man availed himself of both breakfast and bathroom facilities,
    returning to the brig to find a pile of clean clothes on the bunk.</para>

    <para>The commander dismissed the guard who had escorted the man and
    closed his cabin door behind. The two men could now talk in
    private.</para>

    <para>"I was beginning to think that you had missed our rendezvous and I
    had had to leave without you. Then a sheepish crewman reported that he
    thought there was a stowaway as he had a supernumerary on his return from
    shore leave list. We have only just left winter quarters in Rotterdam and
    have had a change of about half of the crew since last year so the new
    names and faces are not familiar yet. Hence you had managed to slip past
    him, much to his embarrassment. He sought to redeem himself by having
    thrown you in the brig where I trust you had a restful night."</para>

    <para>The man reassured him that the hotel service on his ship was of an
    acceptable standard!</para>

    <para>"The crewman I sent to you this morning can be trusted to be
    discrete and the chap from last night is too ashamed of himself to spread
    rumours so your stay with us will be as <emphasis>sub Rosa </emphasis>as
    it can be. We are patrolling the coast as normal as we head towards Den
    Helder where we are to drop you off. Currently we are at IJ-Muiden to make
    sure there is nothing untoward happening.</para>

    <para>The heavy excavation work on construction of the North Sea Canal has
    brought in navvies from Germany and Belgium as well as home grown
    polderlabourers. There are even some English working on the locks, but
    they tend to keep to themselves. Liquor is a problem among the single men
    in the barracks. The families in their makeshift hut and holes in the
    ground are scattered among the sand dunes among the dunes are more of a
    cause for concern as we have practically no control over them and
    infiltration would be a simple matter for German interests. The practice
    of hiring part of the workforce on a daily basis means that strangers can
    come and go practically unnoticed. On top of this there are a lot of
    fishing boats coming off the North Sea for shelter in the estuary and some
    come to trade their catches. Who knows what agents might be coming and
    going by this sea route.</para>

    <para>Not wishing to add to our unfortunate reputation, we have to be wary
    of the sand which accumulates in the harbour despite regular dredging. All
    we can do is send a couple of tenders ashore for a look round and maintain
    a discouraging presence. Assuming we don't encounter any problems, we
    should be on our way north within the hour and dock in Willemsoord at
    around half twelve. You are welcome to use my cabin until then. Is there
    anything you need?"</para>

    <para>The man only had a request for more coffee and maybe a stroopwaffel
    for his sweet tooth.</para>

    <para>As the commander made to leave to take his place on the bridge, he
    turned back with a slight twist to his smile;</para>

    <para>"We are about to set the sails to save eating into our reserves of
    coal and water to run the engine. She doesn't sail well and we have a beam
    sea most of the way so you may end up wishing that we had made one of our
    unscheduled stops!"</para>

    <para>With that he shut the cabin door behind him leaving the man to
    contemplate how long he would hang on to his breakfast.</para>

    <para>Johan Jacob joined three other men in a small meeting room at the
    Willemsoord naval base. All were in uniform but only one other was a naval
    officer whom Johan Jacob outranked - Just. A rather fearsome looking
    <emphasis>Seargeant</emphasis> from the <emphasis>Korps Mariniers
    </emphasis>(or Marines) and a small, wiry chap wearing the unadorned naval
    uniform of a basic <emphasis>Marinier 3e Klasse</emphasis> made up the
    quartet. They were all strangers to one another so sat in silence trying
    to surreptitiously eye each other up. If they were nonplussed so far, they
    were awestruck when they realized that the man who now strode into the
    room sported the <emphasis>Schout-bij-nacht </emphasis>(or Rear Admiral)
    uniform. He had a bundle of official-looking document files under one arm
    and stamped his authority on the briefing by stationing himself behind the
    lectern at the front of the room.</para>

    <para>After a suitable interval to let the room settle and focus attention
    on him, he began;</para>

    <para>"Gentlemen. Your country has need of your services on an
    intelligence mission. You will undoubtedly have read in the newspapers or
    heard by word of mouth about the campaign to conquer the
    <emphasis>Sultanaat</emphasis> <emphasis>Atjeh</emphasis> (or Sultanate of
    Aceh) on the northern tip of Sumatra in the <emphasis>Oost
    Indische</emphasis> (or East Indies). The purpose of the action was to
    consolidate Dutch control over the whole of the island in the light of a
    threat from foreign interests in <emphasis>Atjeh</emphasis>. What is known
    only to a select group, of which you will now become members, is that this
    expedition went even more disastrously wrong than is public
    knowledge."</para>

    <para>Another pause whilst his audience registered their dismay that
    things were even worse than had been commonly understood, which was bad
    enough, then settled again.</para>

    <para>"Catastrophic mistakes were made for which the commanding officer,
    <emphasis>generaal-majoor</emphasis> Kohler, and eighty of his men paid
    with their lives. <emphasis>Atjeh</emphasis> is of enormous importance to
    our <emphasis>koloniale politik </emphasis><emphasis>van</emphasis>
    <emphasis>uitbreiding</emphasis> (or policy of colonial expansion) as it
    represents the last area of Sumatra which remains independent of Dutch
    control. It derives much of its wealth from the growth of pepper and, less
    acceptably, from piracy along its busy coastline. The recent discovery of
    oil fields promises to be of major significance in the future and we need
    these to be a Dutch resource. Incorporating <emphasis>Atjeh</emphasis>
    into Sumatra, with its proximity to Java which is already in Dutch hands,
    is an objective which must be attained.</para>

    <para>Gentlemen, your remit is to ensure that a second expedition does not
    fail. The folders which I am passing out now contain descriptions of the
    action during the first expedition and such analysis of its failure as has
    been made so far. Familiarise yourselves with this material. Subject the
    analysis to scrutiny and be ready to advance the understandings it offers.
    Once we set sail for <emphasis>Atjeh</emphasis> I will furnish you with an
    account of the strategy for the second expedition which is under the
    strictest of security protocols. You will then be in a position to
    identify vital intelligence requirements and to formulate plans for
    gathering and analysing this yourselves.</para>

    <para>You will have plenty of time to complete this phase of your
    operation on the voyage out to <emphasis>Atjeh</emphasis>, some 8,000
    nautical miles even with the shortcut through the Suez Canal. You will
    take ship on the <emphasis>Banda</emphasis> , a newly commissioned
    <emphasis>Riouw</emphasis> class gunship. You have each been selected for
    your different specialist skills so need to get to know each other and
    form effective working relationships. You will also receive input on the
    local languages and customs as well as training on covert operations and
    self defence. I'm afraid that you might also be required to cover for crew
    absences as the <emphasis>Banda</emphasis> does not have space to
    accommodate passengers.</para>

    <para>The Commander of the <emphasis>Banda</emphasis> is expecting you at
    1700 for drinks before a welcome dinner. He expects to depart on the first
    tide tomorrow. I bid you safe voyage, good luck and God speed."</para>

    <para>With that he strode from the room leaving no opportunity for
    questions. The steward assigned to them appeared in his place and escorted
    them to their cabins on the <emphasis>Banda</emphasis> where their kit had
    already been stowed for them.</para>

    <para>The odd quartet were now left to their own devices which presented
    them with their first challenge: how to reconcile their differences in
    rank within the strict chain of command which characterises all armed
    forces with the nature of their mission which required their cooperation
    as equals. It was the ordinary seaman who took the initiative by knocking
    on the other three cabin doors to flush out the occupants. He gestured
    towards the lumpy cloth bag he was holding:</para>

    <para>"I stumbled across an unattended bottle of something spiritus. There
    is a round of cheese to go with it which cook didn't seem to be using. All
    we need to get us started are some vessels to drink from and somewhere
    private to relax. I have a knife for the cheese."</para>

    <para>"Just the ticket!"; barked the Marine, ducking back into his cabin
    to round up an assortment of cups and glasses, the dubious cleanliness of
    which was possibly improved by a quick wipe with his handkerchief.</para>

    <para>There was a palpable release of collectively held breath as the ice
    was broken and everyone accepted that they were stuck with each other so
    had better get on with it!</para>

    <para>Johan Jacob had occupied himself by memorising the plan of the ship
    so led the way to the commodious linen store where they arranged
    themselves in some comfort amongst the sheets and blankets. The other
    naval man contributed to the proceedings by fabricating a means of
    securing the door against intruders, there being no key for the lock. The
    bottle was broached, the cheese was sliced and a round of introductions
    began. It was quickly agreed that they would only use their shortened
    forenames, partly as a social leveler which would also facilitate
    communication but also because it would impede identification by the enemy
    in clandestine operations. They also agreed that it would be helpful if
    they each gave some account of what they thought were their special
    talents which had got them into this situation.</para>

    <para>Johan Jacob elected to go first. He thought of using his nickname
    amongst his drinking circle, 'J J' , but decided that too many people
    would associate that with him personally. Instead he chose to be known to
    the group as 'Jan'. It was easy for him to say why he as there as his only
    talent was that he could read the topography of his location and turn it
    into an accurate map. In the reverse direction, he was able to visualise
    how a map he was reading would appear in the flesh, as it were. Since it
    was one of the well known failings of the first campaign was that they
    went to the wrong place, finding a mosque instead of a Sultan's palace. To
    add to the failure of the campaign, there were no proper maps of the
    interior of <emphasis>Atjeh</emphasis> where it was as easy for the enemy
    to disappear as it was for their pursuers to get lost. Of course, he would
    also need to teach at least some of the men to actually read his maps if
    they were to do nay good!</para>

    <para>" You could do worse than start your lessons with us!"</para>

    <para>This was from the sailor to be known henceforth as 'Piet' . Having
    spoken up it was natural for him to go next. He thought that the others
    might already have guessed at his 'speciality' from the consumables they
    were enjoying! He was a scavenger who could magic up anything that the
    others required just so long as no questions were asked. This 'talent' had
    got him into enough hot water that he had been given the choice of
    'volunteering' for this mission or being dishonourably discharged.
    Civilian life held no attraction for him so, here he was!</para>

    <para>Completing the trio of Navy men, the last was to be known as 'Cor'.
    He had been trained as an engineer but had become bored with the routine
    of his job. What had emerged was his capacity to invent gadgets and find
    work-around fixes for problems. He confessed that some of his inventions
    had a propensity to self-destruct, especially where electricity was
    involved. But, nothing ventured meant nothing gained and, besides, he
    doubted there would be much electricity in the jungle! The opinion was
    ventured that his positive outlook was also an asset!</para>

    <para>Lastly, 'Klaas' thought that his impressive physical size, which had
    been honed to muscular perfection by his Marine training, had something to
    do with his inclusion. He described himself as a fighter and a tireless
    workhorse. He could also spur others on when fatigue or failing spirits
    set in, erring on the side of bullying if necessary!</para>

    <para>As the level in the bottle dwindled and postures tended more towards
    the horizontal, they began to share servicemen's anecdotes and discover
    some commonalities. A persistent hammering on the door interrupted the
    appreciation of one particularly daring escapade. Once they had gone quiet
    the voice of their steward firmly but politely reminded them that they
    were required to attend for dinner with the Commander in 15 minutes time.
    By the time they had stood up, straightened their clothing and opened the
    door there was no sign of the steward. Whist the others were freshening
    themselves up, Piet discreetly returned the now empty bottle where he had
    found it when full and squireled away the remains of the cheese for later
    consumption. He just had time to empty his bladder and slick down his hair
    with spit before heading for the Commander's table.</para>

    <para>Dinner was a pleasant affair with good food and genial company.
    Although the wine was consumed with gusto, the cheese board only received
    desultory attention from the quartet. When it came time to depart after
    coffee and cigars, the merry band took a turn around the deck whilst they
    worked out a plan of action for the next day. They had been provided with
    a program of official inputs with the first being instruction on
    concealment and covert intelligence gathering for two hours after
    breakfast. They needed time to study the material in the folders which
    they had been given so elected to devote the remaining time before
    luncheon to making a start on that, continuing after the meal. At some
    point there needed to be space for fresh air and exercise, with the
    obvious time being once digestion of their luncheon had taken place but
    before washing and dressing for dinner. The daily conference was best
    served by being open-ended so at the end of the day.</para>

    <para/>

    <title/>

    <para>When the Commander said that the <emphasis>Banda</emphasis> would
    leave on the first tide next day he failed to disclose that this would be
    just past midnight. No sooner had 'Jan' descended to the depths of a
    dream-laden slumber than the thudding of the pistons and the rattling of
    the mooring chains being winched in suddenly woke him. The noises of
    departure were familiar to him and he registered the changes in engine
    tone and in the motion of the ship until these settled into a pattern
    which told him that they were out at sea and on their way south. Light
    airs kept the ship under power by steam not sail. Calm seas made for a
    gentle motion which soon lulled 'Jan' back to sleep until the steward
    roused him with hot water for a shave and clean clothes appropriate to the
    informal activities of the coming day.</para>

    <para>'Klaas' had been startled awake by the sounds of their parting
    company from dry land and had never regained the peace of mind necessary
    to resuming sleep. At breakfast he complained bitterly about the merciless
    seas and his consequent inability to sufficiently refuel his bulk from the
    substantial breakfast fare, the sight of which caused a rebellious streak
    in his stomach. Fortunately for this slightly green man, their tutor for
    that morning's session, who was also an indifferent sailor, had heeded the
    sage advice that keeping the horizon in view would be settling and chosen
    a sheltered area of the topsides for their gathering. It didn't take the
    group long to appreciate their tutor's expertise in the area of covert
    operations for it was the man, possibly appearing as himself for
    once.</para>

    <para>The man surveyed the party of men before him and his heart sank as
    he appreciated the obstacles facing them in passing unnoticed among the
    people of Sumatra in their varied environments. The one called 'Klaas' was
    a man mountain with the sandy hair and pink complexion of a Dutch farmer.
    The native population of <emphasis>Atjeh</emphasis> are usually short and
    slight, brown skinned and black haired. 'Piet' could not be more different
    so there was no chance that he could blend in so the best hope was that he
    possessed good concealment potential. Now 'Jan' was a better prospect as
    he had the right sort of dark, straight hair and a complexion that would
    tan nicely. But, his features were not broad enough and he was far too
    tall. On the other hand, 'Cor' was the right height, if rather too well
    upholstered, and had a round face. If only he could take the good from one
    and add it to the good from another! </para>

    <para>The man's hopes rose with the fourth member of the group, 'Piet',
    who was quite unremarkable to look at and had a compact and lithe
    physique. This one already had some of the skills which the man was here
    to develop and, of even greater bearing on the matter at hand, he had good
    instincts. The man, who was in the habit of looking out for others of his
    kind, had already taken note of this one as he went about his supposedly
    clandestine pilfering missions so was glad to have him here where his
    predilections could be moulded and channeled to good effect. </para>

    <para>And so to begin their instruction;</para>

    <para>"We will start with the two cardinal rules of concealment: be still
    and be silent."</para>

    <para>With that, the man paused for ten minutes, demonstrating both rules
    to perfection whilst simultaneously observing the others. </para>

    <para>'Klaas' was managing the still quite well but his ebuliant nature
    got in the way of keeping quiet and the associated communicative
    movements. 'Cor' wasn't doing too badly, once he'd got the message that he
    was supposed to be still and silent. The tall, dark one was clearly a
    quiet man who watched and, maybe, listened rather than talked. However,
    although he probably thought he was completely immobile, the rustle of his
    clothing gave away the small movements of limbs fretting at discomfort and
    inaction. Not a bad start, though. But, the star pupil was 'Piet' who
    cottoned on to what was expected almost immediately, remaining both
    commendably silent and still until his control started to slip after seven
    or eight minutes.</para>

    <para>The man clapped his hands to indicate that the exercise was over,
    making everybody start which provided him with an introduction to the
    necessity of being prepared for the unexpected. Each man was then asked to
    evaluate his own performance with the man reinforcing accurate
    self-perception and adding his own feedback. This was quite revealing of
    their self-perception but they also needed to be able to keenly observe
    others. To enable him to assess their initial capacity for external focus
    the man asked the group to repeat the ten minutes of still silence but
    this time try to notice the movements of others. This time he suggested
    that they settle themselves into a comfortable and sustainable position
    before the ten minutes started. Despite this, the results were mixed as
    watching others tended to distract from self-control.</para>

    <para>It was impressed upon the group that movement, however slight, was
    easily detected by the human visual system which is geared towards signs
    of danger even when at the very edges of their field of vision. The same
    primed detection system applies to hearing, although this sense isn't as
    acute as vision in humans. The sense of smell even less so, but other
    species had different primary senses and could be every bit as lethal the
    human adversaries whom they were seeking to evade. Of course concealment
    was important, and they would come on to that shortly, but even if they
    got caught out in the open, or with scant cover, still and silent were
    their best friends. Even if they failed to escape detection, at least they
    would give the impression of posing no threat.</para>

    <para>Time for another try which yielded at least some improvement all
    round. The man introduced another element into round four. He had arranged
    with the steward to bring a tray of coffee to the room on his signal.
    Everybody was now getting tired, despite their apparent inactivity, so a
    reviving cup of coffee would be highly desirable. Even without that, the
    bustling steward with his rattling tray would have been distraction
    enough. 'Klaas' attempted to deal with the intrusion by screwing his eyes
    shut only to be informed that this was effectively denied him awarebess of
    changes in his surroundings which coukld presage danger. 'Jan' and 'Cor'
    both turned their heads to get a better look when they should have relied
    on peripheral vision and keeping still. The man was sure he heard a
    suppressed groan from 'Cor'. Even 'Piet' succumbed to russlings. They all
    had to endure a final round of feedback before they were praised for their
    not inconsiderable efforts then rewarded with being left to themselves
    with the tray of coffee.</para>

    <para>This introduction to the preparations for their mission had brought
    home to them that this would involve a not inconsiderable element of
    physical threat. If they had entertained the notion that they were off on
    some sort of schoolboy adventure which would be the stuff of ripping yarns
    when they got back home then they were now starting to be disabused of
    this idea. They had been given plenty of food for discussion over coffee
    and deeper thought as they adjourned to study the file of material they
    had been given back at Willwmsoord. </para>

    <para>'Jan' decided that he would lie on his bunk and practice keeping
    still and silent whilst he perused the mission papers. But first he
    inspected the lock on his metal cabin trunk for signs of tampering,
    relieved to see that there were none. Then he retrieved the folder from
    its hiding place, checking that there were no indications that it had been
    discovered. Settling himself comfortably, he made a quick survey of the
    contents, which seemed to be assembled in roughly chronological order. On
    top, however, were some maps and it was these that attracted his attention
    first.</para>

    <para>The first map was intended to educate the geographically ignorant as
    to where Sumatra was, which is to say half a world away. The coastlines of
    Europe, Russia, Africa, China, the Ottoman Empire, Arabia, India, Ceylon,
    Asia and Indonesia were crudely drawn. The positions of their point of
    departure and of the Island of Sumatra, just a pinprick on this large
    canvas, marked by a red dots. A solid ink line rather simplistically
    marked the route they were taking to translate themselves from one red dot
    to the other. 'Jan' knew that this wpuld take them through the Dover
    Straight, into the Mediterranean via the Pinch point at Gibraltar, through
    the Messina Straight and Gela Canal before passing through the new Suez
    Canal to reach the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea then skirting Ceylon to
    head on the final leg across the Indian Ocean to the Dutch East Indies. It
    was indeed half a world away! 'Jan' had never been to the East Indies
    before, only the West Indies and around Europe so he was both excited at
    sailing new waters and frustrated at the quality of the cartography in
    front of him.</para>

    <para>Moving on to the next map, he found a rendition of the islands of
    Java and Sumatra along with the mainland beside Java and the small islands
    off the coast of Sumatra. The next map was a closer look at
    <emphasis>Atjeh</emphasis> itself. 'Jan' couldn't stop himself emitting a
    loud groan. The names of key places were not the same on both maps! A
    closer inspection revealed that the places were not identically located
    either! What was going on! A trip to the charts held on the bridge was in
    order as he was going to have to make his own map from all available
    information and his own skill at resolving the discrepancies. Once they
    arrived, he would have to do more work based on his own
    observations.</para>

    <para>A break for lunch calmed him down and cleared his head ready to
    tackle the written material.</para>
