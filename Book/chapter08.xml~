    <para>Suddenly overwhelmed, her disquet being compounded by the sensation
    that she was about to suffer an unfamiliar and disgraceful emotional
    collpase in public, Paulina cast vaguely about her for some sort of
    refuge. Never had she been so glad to see her friend, Cornelia Droost,
    making haste in her direction. Allowing herself to be guided by Cornelia's
    hand under her elbow, Paulina entered the cool, calm quiet of the Droost
    house where she was passed into the enveloping wings of a plush armchair.
    Tea was ordered and Helena sent for.</para>

    <para>As the disturbance of her arrival died down and the house might
    reasonably be expected to have regained its usual deep silence punctuated
    only by the ponderous tick of the long case clock in the hall, Paulina
    realized that she could still hear the comotion outside which she had
    sought to escape. Granted, the clamour of destruction was muted here yet
    retained the power to unsettle her spirit. When her father had first put
    forward his scheme to demolish the old <emphasis>familie huis</emphasis>
    in order to replace it with something more modern and stylish it had
    seemed a bold idea yet made some kind of sense. The old house was woefully
    lacking in domestic comforts and innovations, it had to be admitted, yet
    this was true of so many properties built by 17th century patricians. Yet
    many wealthy families had stuck to the Dutch way and made alterations to
    their old houses thus giving them a new lease of life. It was obvious to
    Paulina and others that something other than replacing a decaying old
    house was at work in this particular case. Marcellus had proudly explained
    that this was how he wished to mark the anniversary of his fifty years as
    <emphasis>burgermeester</emphasis> of Haastrecht, which was undoubtedly a
    momentous achievement worthy of some grand gesture. But knocking down
    buildings which could have been the basis for a perfectly good house to
    replace them with a completely new one? The family were puzzled and
    dismed, although they might not have shown it in front of
    Marcellus.</para>

    <para>Without telling anyone, Marcellus had set about finding an architect
    who was familiar with the new style of houses currently the fashion in Den
    Haag, having sureptitiously quizzed Paulina and Johan on their opinions of
    their new house. A site visit took place early in 1972 resulting in the
    advice to build the new house on the footprint of the old in order to
    avoid the trouble and expense of putting in new wooden piles for the
    foundations since the existing ones were still in good condition. This
    also had the virtue of keeping to the size of the original plot thus
    obviating the need to negotiate ownership of more land from adjacent
    properties. With his brief clearly established, the architect soon had a
    set of plans for the new Bisdom van Vliet house available for the perusal
    of his client. </para>

    <para>Marcellus was delighted with the look of his new house so set about
    finding suitable master craftsment to build it. He preferred to use local
    men where at all possible, but the architect championed a talented young
    mason and plasterer, Theodorus Hooft, who had experience in the modern
    building techniques so fashioable in Den Haag. Marcellus was impressed by
    Heer Hooft when they met, finding him amiable yet polite. They were soon
    collaborating effortlessly in making a refinements to the original plans
    so as to better fulfilled Marcellus's aspirations. The young man was also
    willing to uproot his wife and young son from their home in Den Haag and
    move the family to Haastrecht in order to be near his client and his place
    of work.</para>

    <para>Then came the day when Marcellus, Heer Hooft at his side, called
    together family and friends for a somewhat theatrical unveiling of his
    radical project. He was so delighted with himself and his vision of the
    future that nobody had the courage to challenge his decision, and Heer
    Hooft seemed such a nice young man who had clearly commited so much to the
    project and worked so hard on behalf of his client. In short, the two men
    put up a united and unassailable front.</para>

    <para>Once the cat was out of the bag the gossiping behind Marcelus's back
    gathered pace and, as is the way of things, soon reached Paulina's
    ears.</para>

    <para>In parlours and kitchens all over the Province of South Holland the
    mention of Marcellus was heard to provoke phrases such as:</para>

    <para>"<emphasis>Hier kan je je ei kwijt ...</emphasis>"</para>

    <para>invited those gathered to privately and openly share their opinions
    on Marcellus's grand plan and "loose their egg here".</para>

    <para>Someone would venture that,</para>

    <para>"<emphasis>Hij heeft een klap van de molen beet!</emphasis>" or
    "<emphasis>Een klap van de molen gehad hebben!</emphasis>" </para>

    <para>to convey the view that he was not acting very wisely as though he
    had been hit by one of the sails on the windmill and has lost his mind as
    a result of it.</para>

    <para>In his defense would come the reply,</para>

    <para>"<emphasis>Leder kaasje heeft zijn gaatje!</emphasis>" </para>

    <para>to caution that every cheese has its hole so nobody's
    perfect.</para>

    <para>The dismayed would reply with,</para>

    <para>"<emphasis>Als de herder verdwaalt dolen the
    schapen.</emphasis>"</para>

    <para>If the shepherd gets lost the sheep just wander around. In other
    words, if the leader goes off in a wrong direction then the sheep don't
    quite know what to do.</para>

    <para>Or,</para>

    <para>"<emphasis>Nu breekt mijn klomp!</emphasis>"</para>

    <para>Now my clog is breaking! I am totally amazed and I certainly didn't
    expect that!'.</para>

    <para>More colourfully,</para>

    <para><emphasis>"In de nesten zitten of werken!</emphasis>"</para>

    <para>He is sitting on a nest! A country expression referring to the
    important task that millers have in keeping the area where the rollers are
    free of birds nests. If birds get in there and build their nests then the
    rollers to turn the cap of the windmill jam resulting in a complete mess.
    So, the more thoughtful gossips have realized that Marcellus finds himself
    confused and not quite knowing what to do.</para>

    <para>The less kindly, or more jealous, counter that,</para>

    <para>"<emphasis>op grote voet leven!</emphasis>"</para>

    <para>He is wealthy, or living on a big foot, so can afford to spend a lot
    of money on his way of life including a new house, furniture, clothing,
    going out and receiving guests.</para>

    <para>Those who envy his social position chip in with,</para>

    <para>"<emphasis>Hij laat de wereld op zijn duim
    draaien!</emphasis>"</para>

    <para>He lets the world spin on his thumb, implying that he has so much
    power!</para>

    <para>Countered by,</para>

    <para>"<emphasis>Je wordt geleefd!</emphasis>"</para>

    <para>He is being lived by life rather than living life and is so busy
    that his life is out of control.</para>

    <para>"<emphasis>Hij heeft het zo druk als de kippen voor
    Pasen!</emphasis>"</para>

    <para>He is as busy as the chickens before Easter!</para>

    <para>One thing all agree on is that,</para>

    <para>"<emphasis>Hij staat vast in zijn schoenen.</emphasis>"</para>

    <para>He stands firmly in his shoes, he knows his own mind and stands his
    ground.</para>

    <para>Inevitably Paulina came to appreciate that the general view was that
    her father has upset people by not doing what they expect him to do.
    Whilst some shared her own thought that his recent personal losses and his
    hectic work schedule had clouded his judgement, all acknowledged that it
    had to be accepted that a man as wealthy, powerful and sure of himself as
    her father was not likely to question his chosen course of action or
    examine the reasons for it. Nor, she would add, is he likely to consider
    the impact on his daughter of seeing her childhood home rased to the
    ground.</para>

    <para>The opportunity that the Droost sisters provided of being able to
    unburden herself to good and trusted friends afforded Paulina some much
    needed relief from her private distress. But then she heard something
    which cast a new light on the situation and discomforted her once again.
    Helena and Cornelia, feeling that they may also speak freely to their
    friend, offered an additional insight concerning Marcellus's possible
    reasoning about the new house. By overhearing the talk around the building
    site, they had come to the view that Marcellus hopes to lure Paulina back
    to live with him permanently by building her a house in the new, Haagse
    style to which he fancies she has become accustomed since moving to her
    newly built marital home in Den Haag. In addition, it seems that he hopes
    that such a grand property, coupled with the rise in status through
    association with himself, might overcome any reluctance on Johan's part to
    settle in Haastrecht. His strategy seems aimed at removing any conflict
    his daughter might feel between her duties to her husband and to her
    father by locating both men in the same place.</para>

    <para>Paulina was astounded by this perspective on matters. Her father had
    been astute only in so far as he recognised how torn she was between her
    life in Den Haag and her ties to her former life, however much she had
    hoped to conceal this from him. Since her mother's death she has felt the
    burden of management tasks fall entirely onto her shoulders whether she
    wanted this or not. It would not be easy to find someone else to assist
    her father in matters which were second nature to her after a lifetime of
    involvement in the Bisdom van Vliet estate. There would be a lot for an
    incommer to get to grips with, not to mention the time it would take her
    to initiate them into the ways things should be done. Then there was the
    question of being able to trust an outsider with matters of business and
    politics which they would not wish broadcast. Perhaps her father had
    everyone's best interests at heart after all, but did it have to involve
    so much destruction!</para>

    <para>Paulina was distracted from her bewilderment and distress by a
    sudden outburst of excitement from Cornelia who had been punctuating their
    discussion with trips to peek around the lace curtain to look down out of
    the big bay window to their first floor salon.</para>

    <para>"Oh, Paulina! Have you met Heer Hooft yet That's him outside now!
    Isn't he handsome! Oh, Paulina, do let's go down so that you can introduce
    us all as you make as if to leave our house!"</para>

    <para>Clearly Cornelia had been smitten by the builder! Feeling that no
    good could come of encouraging her friend in yearning after a married man
    of unkown provenance and unsuitable social standing, Paulina made the
    quite legitimate excuse of not feeling up to such a demanding social
    encounter and wishing remain quietly where she was for a while longer.
    Besides, the three women still had many snippets of news to share and
    discuss.</para>

    <para>At last the clamour outside seemed to have died down to a tolerable
    level. Paulina rose and bade her grateful farewells to the Droost sisters
    before availing herself of the opportunity to venture outside again in
    relative calm. She was to join her father for dinner with their Pastor who
    had insisted that the temporarily homeless Marcellus lodge in his spare
    room on the first floor corner of the Kerkstraat<emphasis>
    pastorie</emphasis>. The two men were lifelong friends and very easy in
    eacother's company so Paulina was looking forward to a relaxed visit and,
    since the weather was fine, enjoying the short stroll to get there.</para>

    <para>Her mind on the pleasures to come, Paulina failed to notice the man
    about to cross her path so was brought back to the present with a jolt
    when Heer Hooft came to a halt and raised his hat to her with the clear
    intention of doing more than just politely greeting her. Indeed, he made
    plain that he knew who she was and begged her indulgence as he introduced
    himself and set about expressing his concern that she had been distressed
    by what she had found when passing her old home earlier that day. She
    sensed his empathy with her emotions as her family home and all its
    memories and associations was reduced to a pile of ugly and useless
    rubble.</para>

    <para>Now having the opportunity to take him in, Paulina found that he
    was, indeed, a handsome man - and surprisingly young-looking to hold such
    a responsible position. She was able to recall seeing him occasionally as
    she drove through the village, a recollection which he was able to
    confirm, saying that he had moved his household to Haastrecht from Den
    Haag almost two years previously. Paulina enquired after his family and
    discovered that his son, Hendrik Willem, was approaching his eighth
    birthday, was doing well at school and had made many friends in the area.
    Paulina remarked that she had moved in the opposite direction, leaving
    Haastrecht for Den Haag upon her marriage. She found him easy company and
    that their encounter was not the socially strained affair that their
    difference in standing had led her to anticipate. So, their first
    conversation came to a well-orchestrated and amicable closure with both
    going their separate ways having made postive comments on the almost
    certainty of their meeting again. As they parted, she caught out of the
    corner of her eye the twitch of a lace curtain at the Droost first floor
    window!</para>

    <para>From another first floor window, her father had been watching for
    her arrival so was waiting on the steps of the pastor's house before
    Paulina had reached the door. He greeted her enthusiatically before
    sweeping her inside to be taken under the wing of the pastor in his salon
    where his wife was waiting to serve refreshements to the small party.
    Marcellus was keen to hear Paulina's impression of the work on his new
    house but Paulina didn't have the heart to tell him how awful she had
    found the whole thing. Her father was more animated than she had seen him
    for a long time and looked in good health. Clearly the new venture was
    doing him good, whatever she might be feeling about it.</para>

    <para>As her visit progressed, Paulina came to understand that her
    father's rejuvenation was at least partly the result of the good food and
    good company he was enjoying at the pastor's house. </para>
