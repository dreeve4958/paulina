    <para/>

    <para>The arrival of Theodorus Hooft caused something of a stir amongst
    the inhabitants of Haastrecht. There had, of course, been rumours that a
    new family had taken a house just beyond the sluis which could be
    interpreted as indicating that they are clearly not patrician or even
    simply wealthy. On the other hand, they were not simple folk who tended to
    live even further out along the dyke in dwellings which could only be
    described as basic or even hovels. The labouring population was almost
    entirely made up of folk born and raised in the village or who had married
    into these local families, but the Hoofts were clearly incomers, thus of
    great concern. The consensus among the watchers had to be that newcomers
    fell somewhere in between the Bisdom van Vliets and the common folk,
    likely the man of the family would be some sort of tradesman.</para>

    <para>Grist to the rumour mill came from the Straver family of carpenters
    who had let it be known that they had been approached by 'building
    interests in Den Haag' with a view to engaging one of them in a 'grand and
    important' local construction project. Details of the Den Haag end of
    things were few and far between, the Straver family being more exercised
    with spreading it about that young Cornelis Straver, at the age of only
    18, was to be given the honour of being a senior journeyman on this
    project. Details of the who, what, when and where of the putative
    construction remained the subject of much inventive conjecture. Thus, as
    soon as a stranger, accompanied by a woman and child, came into view on
    the dyke top word soon spread and people materialised at every vantage
    point to inspect the newcomers and their cart load of possessions as they
    steadily made their way towards their new home.</para>

    <para>As soon as the cart had come to a reliable halt, Theodorus stepped
    down and and raised his arms to help his wife safely down to earth, an
    especially delicate task since, as all could plainly see, she was
    pregnant. Next came a boy of about four who seemed less than keen to
    explore his new home, clinging to his mother's skirt thumb in mouth.
    Having secured his horse, the carter made haste to uncover his cargo and
    carry a chair into the house in order that Mevrouw Hooft might sit and
    recover after their long, uncomfortable journey from Den Haag. A box of
    toys followed in the hope that the young boy might be entertained and not
    get in the way of the men as they unloaded the rest of the family's goods.
    This latter task was arguably facilitated by the many volunteers from
    amongst the curious crowd who would later benefit in the way of kudos,
    taking material form as free food and drink, when disseminating their
    accounts of the family and their things in every detail.</para>

    <para>At last, Theodorus paid the carter and closed the front door on the
    intrusive helpers who had been reluctant to leave. It had been a long day
    indeed! Maria Francina had wanted to supervise the unloading of their
    kitchen equipment, linens and clothing but he had been quite stern about
    making her stay sitting down. Hendrik Willem had been fractious and clung
    to his mother and attempted to do the same to his father, which was rather
    less than convenient He had more than enough to cope with managing the
    location of every unloaded item, especially when people were crowding into
    the small house carrying anything they could lay their hands and requiring
    Theodorus to be in several places at once. He was, frankly, exhausted but
    the day was not over yet as he needed to make a site visit to check on
    progress and make his presence felt among the labourers. It was a
    considerable relief to him when a thoughtful gesture by
    <emphasis>Burgemeester</emphasis> Bisdom van Vliet materialised in the
    shape of two maids who stepped into the middle of the chaos and set about
    making up beds and organising basic kitchen and toileting
    facilities.</para>

    <para/>

    <para>Paulina had never felt so perturbed in all her life, not even when
    she met Johan Jacob. Her uncommon disquiet was compounded by the sensation
    that she was about to be overwhelmed and suffer an uncharacteristic and
    disgraceful public emotional collapse. She desperately cast about for some
    sort of refuge from being exposed to social humiliation. Although she
    would have preferred solitude, nevertheless she was so glad to see her
    friend, Cornelia Droost, making haste in her direction. Allowing herself
    to be guided by Cornelia's hand under her elbow, Paulina entered the cool,
    calm quiet of the Droost house where she was passed into the enveloping
    wings of a plush armchair. Tea was ordered and Helena sent for.</para>

    <para>As the disturbance of her arrival died down, the Droost house tried
    to regain its usual deep silence only punctuated only by the ponderous
    tick of the long case clock in the hall. But not today and a miserable
    Paulina realized that she could still hear the commotion outside from
    which she so badly wanted to escape. Granted, the clamour of destruction
    was now muted by the fabrics and furnishings of the house, yet the sounds
    of wrecking that filtered through retained the power to unsettle her
    spirit. It was incomprehensible yet it manifestly true that the home she
    had grown up in, which had seemed so solid, secure, immutable even, was
    being reduced to unrecognisable chunks of stone and wood accompanied by
    clouds of dust. Oh, so much commotion and chaos! Horrified, she could feel
    herself about to swoon in front of other people, even if they were her
    oldest and best friends.</para>

    <para>When her father had first put forward his scheme to demolish the old
    <emphasis>familie huis</emphasis> his idea was clearly a bold one but, the
    way he presented it, seemed to make sense. His vision was to replace the
    existing arbitrary assemblage of buildings with a single, modern and
    stylish property. Part of his argument was that the old house was woefully
    lacking in domestic comforts and innovations, yet this was true of so many
    properties built by 17th century patricians. Many wealthy families had
    stuck to the Dutch way and periodically made additions and adaptations to
    their old houses thus giving them a new lease of life. It was obvious to
    Paulina and others that something more than replacing an old house, which
    was not exactly falling into ruins, was at work here. Marcellus's next
    point was incontestable. A new house was the way he wished to mark the
    anniversary of his fifty years as <emphasis>burgermeester</emphasis> of
    Haastrecht, which was undoubtedly a momentous achievement worthy of some
    grand gesture. But knocking down buildings which could have been the basis
    for a perfectly good house then to replace them with a completely new one?
    The family were puzzled and dismayed, although they attempted to hide this
    from the proud and elated Marcellus.</para>

    <para>With the utmost secrecy, Marcellus had set about finding an
    architect who was familiar with the new style of houses currently the
    fashion in Den Haag. He wanted something that had the same character as
    Paulina and Johan's new house, on the subject of which he had
    surreptitiously quizzed the couple and received glowing reports. The
    architect paid a site visit to Haastrecht early in 1972 which resulted in
    the advice to build the new house on the footprint of the old one. This
    strategy would avoid the trouble and expense of putting in new wooden
    piles for the foundations since the existing ones were still in good
    condition. It also had the virtue of keeping to the size of the original
    plot thus obviating the need to negotiate ownership of more land from
    adjacent properties. With his brief clearly established, the architect
    soon had a set of plans for the new Bisdom van Vliet house available for
    the perusal of his client.</para>

    <para>Marcellus was delighted with the look of his new house so set about
    finding suitable master craftsmen to build it. He preferred to use local
    men where at all possible, but the architect championed a talented young
    mason and plasterer, Theodorus Hooft, who had experience in the modern
    building techniques currently in demand in Den Haag. Marcellus was
    impressed by Heer Hooft when they met, finding him amiable yet polite.
    They were soon collaborating effortlessly in making a refinements to the
    original plans so as to better fulfil Marcellus's aspirations. The young
    man was also willing to uproot his wife and young son from their home in
    Den Haag and move the family to Haastrecht in order to be near his client
    and his place of work.</para>

    <para>Then came the day when Marcellus, Heer Hooft at his side, called
    together family and friends for a somewhat theatrical unveiling of his
    radical project. He was so delighted with himself and his vision of the
    future that nobody had the courage to challenge his decision, and Heer
    Hooft seemed such a nice young man who had clearly committed so much to
    the project and worked so hard on behalf of his client. In short, the two
    men put up a united and unassailable front.</para>

    <para>Once the cat was out of the bag the gossips got to work. In parlours
    and kitchens all over the Province of South Holland the mention of
    Marcellus was heard to provoke phrases such as:</para>

    <para>"<emphasis>Hier kan je je ei kwijt ...</emphasis>"</para>

    <para>as a ringleader would invite those around them to openly share their
    opinions on Marcellus's grand plan and "loose their egg here", allegedly
    in private.</para>

    <para>Then someone would venture that,</para>

    <para>"<emphasis>Hij heeft een klap van de molen beet!</emphasis>" or
    "<emphasis>Een klap van de molen gehad hebben!</emphasis>"</para>

    <para>to convey the view that he was not acting very wisely as though he
    had been "hit by one of the sails on the windmill" and has lost his mind
    as a result of it.</para>

    <para>In his defense would come the reply,</para>

    <para>"<emphasis>Leder kaasje heeft zijn gaatje!</emphasis>"</para>

    <para>to caution that "every cheese has its hole" so nobody's
    perfect.</para>

    <para>The dismayed would retort,</para>

    <para>"<emphasis>Als de herder verdwaalt dolen the
    schapen.</emphasis>"</para>

    <para>"If the shepherd gets lost the sheep just wander around." In other
    words, if the leader goes off in a wrong direction then other people don't
    quite know what to do.</para>

    <para>Or,</para>

    <para>"<emphasis>Nu breekt mijn klomp!</emphasis>"</para>

    <para>"Now my clog is breaking!" I am totally amazed and I certainly
    didn't expect that!.</para>

    <para>More colourfully,</para>

    <para><emphasis>"In de nesten zitten of werken!</emphasis>"</para>

    <para>"He is sitting on a nest!" A country expression referring to the
    important task that millers have in keeping the area where the top rollers
    are free of birds nests. If birds get in there and build their nests then
    the rollers to turn the cap of the windmill jam resulting in a complete
    mess. So, the more thoughtful gossips have realized that Marcellus finds
    himself confused and not quite knowing what to do.</para>

    <para>The less kindly, or more jealous, counter that,</para>

    <para>"<emphasis>op grote voet leven!</emphasis>"</para>

    <para>He is wealthy, or "living on a big foot", so can afford to spend a
    lot of money on whatever he wants,including a new house.</para>

    <para>Those who envy his social position chip in with,</para>

    <para>"<emphasis>Hij laat de wereld op zijn duim
    draaien!</emphasis>"</para>

    <para>"He lets the world spin on his thumb", implying that he has too much
    power!</para>

    <para>Countered by,</para>

    <para>"<emphasis>Je wordt geleefd!</emphasis>"</para>

    <para>"He is being lived by life" rather than living life and is so busy
    that his life is out of control.</para>

    <para>"<emphasis>Hij heeft het zo druk als de kippen voor
    Pasen!</emphasis>"</para>

    <para>"He is as busy as the chickens before Easter!"</para>

    <para>One thing all agree on is that,</para>

    <para>"<emphasis>Hij staat vast in zijn schoenen.</emphasis>"</para>

    <para>"He stands firmly in his shoes" so he knows his own mind and stands
    his ground.</para>

    <para>Inevitably the village chatter reached Paulina, who came to
    appreciate that the general view was that her father has upset people by
    not doing what they expected him to do. Whilst some shared her own thought
    that his recent personal losses and his hectic work schedule had clouded
    his judgement, all acknowledged that it had to be accepted that a man as
    wealthy, powerful and sure of himself as her father was not likely to
    question his chosen course of action or examine the reasons for it. Nor,
    she would add, is he likely to consider the impact on his daughter of
    seeing her childhood home razed to the ground.</para>

    <para>So,once she had grasped it, the opportunity that the Droost sisters
    provided of being able to unburden herself to good and trusted friends
    afforded Paulina some much needed relief from her private distress. But
    then she heard something which cast a new light on the situation and upset
    her once again. Helena and Cornelia, feeling that they may also speak
    freely to their friend, offered an additional insight concerning
    Marcellus's motivation behind the new house. By overhearing the talk
    around the building site, they had come to the view that Marcellus hopes
    to lure Paulina back to live with him permanently by building her a house
    in the style to which he fancies she has become accustomed in Den Haag. In
    addition, it seems that he hopes that such a grand property, coupled with
    the rise in status through association with himself, might overcome any
    reluctance on Johan's part to settle in Haastrecht. His strategy seems
    aimed at removing any conflict his daughter might feel between her duties
    to her husband and to her father by locating both men in the same
    place.</para>

    <para>Paulina was astounded by this perspective on matters. Her father had
    been astute only in so far as he recognised how torn she was between her
    life in Den Haag and her ties to her former home, however much she had
    hoped to conceal this from him. Since her mother's death she has felt the
    burden of management of the family's fall entirely onto her shoulders
    whether she wanted this or not. It would not be easy to find someone else
    to assist her father in matters which were second nature to her after a
    lifetime of involvement in the Bisdom van Vliet estate. There would be a
    lot for an incomer to get to grips with, not to mention the time it would
    take her to initiate them into the ways things should be done. Then there
    was the question of security and being able to trust an outsider with
    matters of business and politics which they would not wish broadcast.
    Perhaps her father had everyone's best interests at heart after all, but
    did it have to involve so much destruction!</para>

    <para>Paulina was distracted from her bewilderment and distress by a
    sudden outburst of excitement from Cornelia who had been punctuating their
    discussion with trips to peek around the lace curtain at the big bay
    window to their first floor salon from which vantage point she could look
    down into the street.</para>

    <para>"Oh, Paulina! Have you met Heer Hooft yet That's him outside now!
    Isn't he handsome! Oh, Paulina, do let's go down so that you can introduce
    us all. If you make as if to leave our house it would seem quite
    natural!"</para>

    <para>Clearly Cornelia had been smitten by the builder! Feeling that no
    good could come of encouraging her friend in yearning after a married man
    of unknown provenance and unsuitable social standing, Paulina made the
    quite legitimate excuse of not feeling up to such a demanding social
    encounter and wishing remain quietly where she was for a while longer.
    Besides, the three women still had many snippets of news to share and mull
    over.</para>

    <para>At last the clamour outside seemed to have died down to a tolerable
    level as the working day came to an end. Paulina rose and bade her
    grateful farewells to the Droost sisters before availing herself of the
    opportunity to venture outside again in relative calm. She was to join her
    father for dinner with their Pastor who had insisted that the temporarily
    homeless Marcellus lodge in the first floor corner room of his
    Kerkstraat<emphasis> pastorie</emphasis>. The two men were lifelong
    friends and very easy in each other's company so Paulina was looking
    forward to a relaxed visit and, since the weather was fine, enjoying the
    short stroll on the way there.</para>

    <para>Her mind on the pleasures to come, Paulina failed to notice the man
    about to cross her path so was brought back to the present with a jolt
    when Heer Hooft slowed to a halt in order to avoid a collision. He raised
    his hat to her with the clear intention of doing more than just politely
    greeting her before resuming his journey. Indeed, he made plain that he
    knew who she was and begged her indulgence as he introduced himself. It
    seems that he had noticed her visit to the building site earlier on and
    how distressed she had been by what she had found taking place there. He
    graciously expressed his concern for her and enquired as to how she now
    fared. She sensed his empathy with her feelings at seeing her family home
    and all its memories and associations reduced to a pile of ugly and
    useless rubble.</para>

    <para>Now having the opportunity to take him in, Paulina found that he
    was, indeed, a handsome man who was surprisingly young-looking to hold
    such a responsible position. He told her that he had just moved his
    household to Haastrecht from Den Haag so as to be more closely involved
    with her father's project. Paulina enquired after his family and
    discovered that he had a son, Hendrik Willem, who was approaching his
    fourth birthday and that his wife was expecting their second child in a
    month or so. Paulina remarked that she had moved in the opposite
    direction, leaving Haastrecht for Den Haag upon her marriage a few years
    earlier. She found him easy company and that their encounter was not the
    socially strained affair that their difference in standing had led her to
    anticipate. So, their first conversation came to a well-orchestrated and
    amicable closure with both going their separate ways having made positive
    comments on the almost certainty of their meeting again. As they parted,
    she caught out of the corner of her eye the twitch of a lace curtain at
    the Droost first floor window!</para>

    <para>From another first floor window, her father had been watching for
    her arrival so was waiting on the steps of the pastor's house before
    Paulina had reached the door. He greeted her enthusiastically before
    sweeping her inside to be taken under the wing of the pastor in his salon
    where his wife was waiting to serve refreshments to the small party.
    Marcellus was keen to hear Paulina's impression of the work on his new
    house but Paulina didn't have the heart to tell him how awful she had
    found the whole thing. Her father was more animated than she had seen him
    for a long time and looked in good health. Clearly the new venture had
    given him a fillip, whatever she might be feeling about it.</para>

    <para>As her visit progressed, Paulina came to understand that her
    father's rejuvenation was at least partly the result of the good food and
    congenial company he was enjoying at the pastor's house. The temporary
    hiatus in his own domestic affairs, since there now was no household, had
    also lifted some of the burden he usually carried. </para>
