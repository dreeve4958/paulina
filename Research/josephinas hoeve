The name of the Josephina's Hoeve finds its origin in Haas (ZH) on the farm with the same name. The homestead was built in 1780 by order of the ancestors of Paul van Vliet Diocese (1840-1923), widow of John Jacob Le Fevre de Montigny, who was then mayor of Haas. She later had the 99 farms owned. It is said that in the dim past there at the 99 farms had maintained a company of soldiers.
