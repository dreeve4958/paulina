Dear Mr Someren,

Please forgive both the intrusion and that I write in English (my Dutch is not so good!).

Whilst cruising in our motor yacht, Eleanor, my husband and I have visited Haastrecht several times. I have become fascinated by the story of Paulina Bisdom van Vliet to the extent that I plan to write a historical novel based on her story as I am sure that others will be engaged by this, too. The research and writing will also be my pleasure. I have your biography of her (and a Dutch friend and neighbour who helps when I get stuck with translation) so it seemed a good idea to contact you.

You may not like the idea of an English novel about Paulina, of course. But, if you are kind enough to help my research then that would be wonderful. My aim is to place the fictional part of the story within a geographical, social, and historical context that is as accurate as possible.

I hope that you will be generous enough to reply.

Best wishes

Diane
