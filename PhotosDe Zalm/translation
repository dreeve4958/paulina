	 HOTEL DE ZALM
Markt Gouda

The inn by the name of THE OLD SALMON 
is said to be the oldest one of the country. 
When the owner wanted to enlarge the place 
they told him that the roof 
should at least be 1.70 meter lower 
than the one of the Weighing House. 
He had to do what him was told 
but he expressed his anger 
by having a stone tablet put in the sidewall 
with the sarcastic text:

NOT TOO HIGH, NOT TO LOW, BUT JUST FITTING. 

In the third quarter of the 19th century the inn 
was reconstructed and made taller. 
The name reminds us of the old times 
when the fishermen of Gouda fished salmon 
in the river Yssel.
